I used to make the annual pilgrimage to Mobile World Congress (albeit when it was in Cannes) but I’ve not been for a few years. This was one of the years I would have loved to be there…just to get the vibe from Friday’s news of Microsoft and Nokia getting together. I’m sure that’ll still be the big talking point over tapas and sangria but just to ensure you’re up to speed on the latest news from Steve Ballmer’s keynote Also a cool tech demo of Kinect support on Windows Phone 7 showed up

 All goodness. Now…back to the Nokia discussion <!--
