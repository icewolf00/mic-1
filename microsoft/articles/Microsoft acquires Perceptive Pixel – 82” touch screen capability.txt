Far too much to write about from this morning’s Worldwide Partner Conference keynote so just one thing for now…Microsoft is acquiring Perceptive Pixel Inc.Steve Ballmer introduced Jeff Han, the founder, who took to the stage to demonstrate the incredible 82” touch screen running Windows 8. It’s the world’s largest projected capacitive, optically bonded multi-touch display and supports both touch and pen based input. Jeff’s demo of OneNote was particularly impressive. Head to Digital WPC to see the morning keynote and jump to the 03:07:00 spot to see the demo.I’ve written many times on this blog about how we see a future of displays everywhere and with Perceptive Pixel, that future gets one step closer.Tweet
