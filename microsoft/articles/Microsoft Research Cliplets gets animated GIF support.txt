I’m a big fan of Cliplets from Microsoft Research – a small, free application you can download to create “cinemagraphs”. When I show people the mini movies that Cliplets creates they often ask if it’s an animated GIF. The answer until now has been no but during a chance meet with Neel Joshi last week (he’s one of the creators) he mentioned to me that Cliplets can now output an animated GIF.Microsoft Research Cliplets is provided free of charge and without official support. However, there is an active Cliplets Forum – their requests led to animated GIF support. Also be sure to check out the very useful tutorials to ensure you’re getting the best from Cliplets.Tweet
