Has Flickr just set a new bar in beautiful design on Windows Phone 7? From my initial use, the answer is yes. Apart from the login screen (which is lame IMHO), this is a fine example of what is possible with WP7. Once logged in to my account, my files stores in the Flickr cloud seamlessly appeared on the device and the panoramic hub concept has been used to great effect – quickly allowing you to skip between photo stream, profile, sets, favorites and galleries. Uploading was elegantly integrated with the photo library on the phone and performance was pretty good (I look forward to seeing how this performs with the forthcoming performance upgrade).Nice work from Flickr…and free. Go grab it!thanks to wpcentral and David Webster for the heads up<!--
