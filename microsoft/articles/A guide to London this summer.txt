It’s rare that we have weekend post here on NEXT but I felt this was a good fit given it’s somewhat off the topic of technology.If you happen to be traveling to London this summer, I came across a few resources while researching for a friend that I thought were worth sharing. London will play host to The Olympics and the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee this summer but there are plenty of other things going on too including a celebration of the 200th birthday of Charles Dickens and a world Shakespeare festival. In total there are 62,738 events.How do I know that? Thanks to the guys I met a few years back at LondonTown.com – they have put together a great set of resources including the map above and the TOWN book that includes their hand picks of the 400 best events in London during 2012.If you’re heading to London, or even if you live in London, I think you’ll enjoy their resources to guide you through an epic summer.Tweet
