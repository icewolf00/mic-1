The Kinect Accelerator has been getting a lot press in the last few weeks and rightly so as the 11 startups housed at our Westlake, Seattle office are cranking out some impressive work using the Kinect for Windows hardware and SDK. Dina Bass of Bloomberg Businessweek wrote up a great report following her recent visit, noting that almost 500 startups applied for the accelerator program, which is co-hosted by TechStars. Todd Bishop of GeekWire and Michael Gorman of Engadget also wrote up their trip reports.On June 28, the program culminates with the entrepreneurs meeting potential investors. Along the way they have been gathering mentorship on all aspects of operating a startup – everything from how to make that final pitch to how to tweak their code.The video above shows the program in action and over the next few days, I’ll be profiling two of the startups that caught my eye. With the Westlake office only a block and a half from my apartment, I’ve been keeping a close watch on their developments by dropping in over the past few weeks to see their progress and snap a few photographs – they’ve turned my regular workspace upside down, but with good results!Tweet
