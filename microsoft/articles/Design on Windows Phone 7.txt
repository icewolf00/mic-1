Another funky new app on Windows Phone 7 – I love Desingspiration as it covers most of the design sites I already follow in my RSS feed – so I can cross them off from there. Core 77, Cool Hunting, Design Mind, Smashing Magazine and more. It helps keep the frustrated designer in me very happy. As you would expect, it’s elegantly designed with great use of the horizontal reading concept. $1.29 or a free trial. <!--
