With all this chatter today about wearable computing I figured it’d be worthwhile reposting the story we ran back in August about The Printing Dress. Given it won Best Concept and Best in Show at International Symposium on Wearable Computers in San Francisco I figured it deserved to be added to the discussion.You may even get the chance to see me (and others) wearing this dress within the next month….news on that soon.It’s not the only wearable computing project going on around Microsoft. Check out Pocket Touch and other muscle computing interfaces. Oh and did I mention bionic contact lenses – covered in the NY Times as it happens. Just a few of the projcts we have underway.Tweet
