 Have you ever been frustrated that you missed the perfect shot when taking photos using your Smartphone?BLINK, a new Windows Phone 8 application from Microsoft Research aims to fix that issue. BLINK captures a burst of images with a single click and then allows you to select the perfect image from those that were taken with a swipe of the finger. It’s simple to use and includes image stabilization technology…and, as you would expect, BLINK shows up as a lens on Windows Phone 8. Rob Knies talked with one of the researchers who developed BLINK. You can also see it in action in the video above and grab it from the Windows Phone Store now.
