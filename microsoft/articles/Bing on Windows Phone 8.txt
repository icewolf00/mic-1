One of the topics I talk about fairly regularly at Microsoft is how we’re bringing some many of our assets together in the new wave of products – all in the name of providing more seamless experiences. Bing is a fine example of this – not only is Bing a search engine, it’s an asset that helps to power some unique experiences across Windows, Windows Phone and Xbox. The Bing team recently posted about the full set of capability that is brought to Windows Phone 8 and I’ll highlight a few things here. Bing on the lock screen – as shown above, on Windows Phone 8 your home screen can be set to change every day to feature the daily image from Bing.com Bing Explore – as shown below the Bing search screen on Windows Phone 8 invites you to swipe to the right to explore trending stories, local deals and more. Those are just two of the new features. The Bing blog has a comprehensive list.
