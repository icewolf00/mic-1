As you may have seen yesterday, Lync 2010 for Windows Phone appeared in the Windows Phone Marketplace. This is one I’ve been waiting on for a while after seeing it demonstrated at a few events over the last few months.I spend a good deal of my time on conference calls here at Microsoft (I know, I know…) and this applications killer feature for me is one click conference join feature. No more trying to remember crazy pin codes…just one click and I’m in the call.As BJ Haberkorn says on the UC blog If your company is already using Lync 2010, you’ll need to enable the functionality before users can take advantage: this NextHop blog has details for on premises customers, and this Office 365 community article provides information for Lync Online. Once the mobile clients have been enabled, users can download and begin using Lync 2010 for Windows Phone today, with other platforms coming soon. Lync 2010 clients for iPhone, iPad, Android, and Nokia Symbian have been submitted for approval to their respective app stores and you can get the latest update regarding availability. Tweet
