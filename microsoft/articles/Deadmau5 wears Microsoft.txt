For an ambitious young person, landing a Microsoft internship is a resume-building bonanza. The experience also comes with some pretty sweet perks.Employees at Jim Henson’s Creature Shop created a special Deadmau5 mask featuring Microsoft iconography.Last week, for example, a lucky group of interns was treated to a surprise concert by EDM legend Deadmau5 and Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, Seattle’s hip-hop hometown heroes. (Deadmau5 jokingly dubbed the duo “Mackelmau5” in a post on Instagram.) Deadmau5 scored extra credit by rocking a special Microsoft-themed version of his trademark mask, designed by Jim Henson’s Creature Shop.Here’s a closer look:Wish I could have been there, but at least I’ll be able to check out the mask up close: it’s going up in a display here on campus.
