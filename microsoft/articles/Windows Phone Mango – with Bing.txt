I’ve been showing a lot of people the Bing features in Windows Phone Mango recently and one friend last week remarked that we really ought to show this stuff off some more – he was particularly impressed in my ability to translate an English menu in to Chinese. The reality is it would have been a better demo for me to translate a Chinese menu to English but he got the point! Anyhoo…four news adverts from the Windows Phone team have arrived to help me show the features to more people. Vision search, quick cards, app connect, bar code, Microsoft Tag, QR code scanning, local scout and voice directions. It’s all in there and now I have a place to send people for better demos than mine.hat tip to WPCentral for spotting these.Tweet
