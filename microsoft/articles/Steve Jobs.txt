I’ve held off posting here to respect Steve Jobs’ passing and decided this evening that it was the right thing to do to publish this post.I’ve admired and respected Steve from afar for a very long time. When I walked in to my apartment this evening, after 3 days on the road, I stopped a little longer in the hallway and looked at the Mac Classic that sits on my bookshelf. It’s an icon, like the man himself. RIP Steve. Words from other Microsoft folks in case you’ve not seen them….Bill GatesMicrosoft CEO Steve BallmerOffice for Mac TeamTweet
