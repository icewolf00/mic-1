Okay, not strictly a photograph from around Microsoft as this was taken in downtown Seattle but I still thought worth sharing. We have Verizon to thanks for this beautiful new sculpture in the downtown area. Inside were elves helping Santa Claus put Windows Phones in to a his sleigh ready for delivery. Not really…but that would have been fun.
