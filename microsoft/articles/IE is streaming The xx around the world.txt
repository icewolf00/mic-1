Â A cool little project from The xxÂ with Internet Explorer that uses HTML5 and streams The xxâ€™s new album, Coexist, has been shared around the world. Each tweet, email or Facebook post is denoted by the start of a curve and the end of the curve shows a new listener.Â By using your mouse (or finger if youâ€™re running IE10 on Windows 8 ðŸ™‚ ) to move the time slider up and down on the right of the map, you can interact with the visualization to see how the experience was shared over time.Oh and you can listen to a stream of the album from the site at coexist.thexx.info ahead of the Sept 11th release date. More details from the Internet Explorer team blog.Â Share
