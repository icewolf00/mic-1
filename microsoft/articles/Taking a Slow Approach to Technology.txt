One of the things I like about Richard Banks is that he’s either involved in or comes across some of the most unique applications of technology. A great example of this is the work he’s part of at Microsoft Research Cambridge around exploring the design implications of slow technology. Below are a couple examples, both built by Larissa Pschetz, a PhD student from Edinburgh University, during an internship with Richard.  Movement Crafter combines motion sensors into a pair of knitting needles. The motion sensors transmit data to a screen that will visualize your progress. And what’s cool is that the screen can also display the work of others in a virtual knitting group. The second project, appropriately titled the Long Living Chair, endows a basic rocking chair with digital memory. The idea behind this project is that over the span of many years user can track how many times the chair has been used and create a bit more of a relationship with it.  Both projects really seem to epitomize the slow technology movement, which is all about using technology to encourage moments of quiet reflection and meaningful connection, rather than always being “connected” or productive.
