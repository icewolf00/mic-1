It’s been a busy few weeks of travel for me and one device has been by my side all of that time – Surface 2. It’s drawn some admiring glances and rightly so – the new color attracts attention, the two stage kickstand, the speed and the weight. Oh and that beautiful HD screen.As the video says, right now it really is the one device in my life.
