One of the most popular apps for Windows Phone became available on Windows Phone 8 this week. The app has over 1 million downloads and average ratings between 4 and 5 stars since release. In short, it’s a killer app for Windows Phone that combines augmented reality translation using the camera, text translation using either the camera or keyboard and speech translation. In a post on the Microsoft Translator blog, Vikram Dendi explains that the team has been hard at work readying the Windows Phone 8 version and has taken advantage of the new Lens feature in the OS. Now when you hit the camera button you can load translator as a lens that gives you instant access to the camera based translation capabilities.As Taylor Soper mentioned over on GeekWire this is an app that just make you say “wow”. It’s useful – and free! I’ve personally used the app for translation Italian menus in restaurants, giving direction in Spanish and generally turning myself in to a polyglot. Check out the original video to see the background on this amazing app.
