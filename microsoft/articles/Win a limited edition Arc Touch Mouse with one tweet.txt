Microsoft Hardware is celebrating their 30th anniversary this year and as part of the celebrations they’re offering up the chance to win a one-of-a-kind 30th anniversary Arc Touch Mouse. Each mouse is hand-painted and only 30 were made. Lance Ulanoff of Mashable recently got his hands on one.All you have to do is send a tweet to @MSFTHardware with your favorite ‘80s memory and ensure you have #MSHWturns30 in the tweet!Oh and that mouse up there on the left? That’s the very first Microsoft mouse, fondly known as The Green-Eyed Monster.Tweet
