At Microsoft, dreaming up ideas is part of our DNA. It’s all about making the impossible possible. As you read last week in our series called Places Week, we have buildings that offer large work areas, cozy corners and sunlit open spaces. These are often the places where we turn our dreams into possibilities.No place speaks to that result more than the Microsoft Home – a glimpse into what a living space may look like in the future. The idea behind the creation of the Home came from Craig Mundie, Microsoft’s chief research and strategy officer. Since its inception in 1994, the Home has been visited by hundreds of thousands of people, including presidents, company partners, and celebrities.Because of zoning and capacity constraints, the Home is closed to the public, but I thought it would be great to let you have a look for yourself.In many ways, the future is already here. It is in the home of today where people interact with people and with technology. We’ve told you about how NUI has played a big role in that experience. Naturally interfacing with XBox Kinect, the use of voice, vision and gesture has expanded the meaning of home entertainment. And, as Microsoft Home demonstrates, the experience will only get better.Our friends at Microsoft News Center recently featured a story that describes the Home in detail and provides a hint at what our dream home will look – and act – like in the future.Meanwhile, we’ll keep on dreaming.
