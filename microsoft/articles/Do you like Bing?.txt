…it seems like more and more people like Bing – whether it’s the home page images or the shift towards being a decision engine, Bing is making waves (speaking of which, I want that waves infused Bing homepage…now!)….If you like a Bing homepage image, you can now voice your support with the addition of a Facebook like button at the bottom of the homepage. Kip Kniskern of Liveside spotted this addition earlier today and a tweet from the Bing team confirmed it. <!--
