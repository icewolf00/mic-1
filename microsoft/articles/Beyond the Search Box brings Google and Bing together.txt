Next week I’ll be down in San Francisco for Farsight 2011: Beyond the Search Box. This event gathers industry leaders for a series of demos and discussion about the future of search. It’s brought to you by Big Think and Bing and is designed to go beyond the race for a better “ten blue links”. It certainly has potential with Matt Cutts from Google, Harry Shum from Bing, and Rich Skrenta of Blekko on hand. Add to that Peter Thiel, Chris Ahlberg and Esther Dyson and we have the makings of a fiery discussions. I’ll pack my flame retardant pants.  It’ll be live streamed from 10am – 2pm PST on February 1st and I’ll be on hand to give you a live view from the floor, posting photos and hopefully getting behind the scenes somewhat. You can pre-submit questions using the hashtag #FutureSearch. To whet our appetite, a series of videos has been posted, starting with Maclolm Gladwell above and including Garry Kasparov. <!--
