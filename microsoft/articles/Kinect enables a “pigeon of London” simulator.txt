I’m always up for hearing about new ways to use Kinect and when it involves London, I’m even more intrigued. This ‘Pigeon Simulator’ was created by a team of researchers from the University College London and literally enables you to see London as a pigeon does – replete with flapping wings but minus the annoying ‘white debris’ habit the creatures have.The system doesn’t use the Kinect for Windows SDK and uses Google Maps but nonetheless, I like it, if only because I could see London in a totally new light. You can also see additional details overlaid such as air pollution or traffic congestion.thanks to PSFK for the heads upTweet
