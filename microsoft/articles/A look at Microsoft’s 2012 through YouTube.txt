&amp;amp;amp;nbsp;One of the things I check fairly regularly is the videos that various Microsoft teams post to YouTube.Over the last year there have been a ton of videos so I started to collect some of them in to a ‘reel’ that combined some many of my favorites and also aimed to tell some of the story of an epic year for the company. Microsoft’s News Center published a video last week that’s A Year of Microsoft Milestones which is well worth a look as it truly chronicles the major milestones of 2012 for the company. What I’ve curated here is more of a personal “greatest hits of Microsoft on YouTube”. I don’t expect anyone to view the full 33 minutes 45 seconds of videos but I thought it’d be a fun way to look at the year.Collectively the videos here have amassed almost 20 million views and though there are some well known ones in there – such as my personal favorite, the Surface by Microsoft video – there are some hidden gems that deserve more views. Notable in this category in my opinion are Dance Central 3 TV Commercial featuring Usher, The New Entertainment Experience From Xbox and the brilliant Reignite Your Passion from Microsoft Dynamics. Here is the full lineup of videos – any I missed that you would include?    *technically there are 33 videos in the reel – I added the Microsoft Unveils a new look at the end as a bookend.
