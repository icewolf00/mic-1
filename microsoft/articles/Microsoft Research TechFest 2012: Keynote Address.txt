We’ve had a few days of amazing tech on the blog thanks to Microsoft Research TechFest. I thought it would be worth putting this work in context and aligning to a few important trends we’re exploring at Microsoft. Fortunately, Rick Rashid, Microsoft Chief Research Officer, did precisely that on Tuesday morning and he’s far more articulate than I am. Hit play on the video above to hear Rick offer his vision for the future of computing research and the resources Microsoft Research can bring to bear on the evolution of computing.Included in the talk are two terrific demonstrations – text to speech translation that shows Craig Mundie speaking Mandarin and FetchClimate!, my favorite demo from all of TechFest this year.Tweet
