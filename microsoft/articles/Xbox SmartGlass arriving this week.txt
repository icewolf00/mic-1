 I remember when we announced the original Xbox and commentators scoffed at the idea of a games console from Microsoft. Well Xbox has grown up in to a multi-talented 10 year-old and has moved way, way beyond its gaming roots. It still has the most epic games but it now has so much more – a quick glance at the new Xbox home page makes that pretty clear.  ….and with Xbox SmartGlass we’re adding in some magic to its skillset. There is something quite pleasing about controlling my TV from my Windows 8 PC or my Windows Phone – flicking music and movies around like a conductor in my own home. Equally pleasing is discovering content on one screen and playing it on another – in fact, it’s incredibly liberating.SmartGlass has sooooo much to offer – the video above shows you just some of the capabilities. Yusuf Mehdi’s post on the Official Microsoft Blog details many more and also explains why Xbox is set for another epic year.
