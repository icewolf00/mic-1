My friends over on Channel 9 took the wraps off Coding4Fun this week – a website to show off fun and cool open source hardware and software projects. The projects span the range from beginner to advanced to the downright crazy. See exhibit A below…an email Clint Rutkas received “inviting” him to build a keynote demo. I also found Currency Converter for Windows Phone 7 on Coding4Fun and I’m currently reading about FaceLight – Silverlight 4 Real-Time Face Detection.  Coding4Fun started out in 2005 as a bunch of MSDN articles but has now matured in to this site full of code samples, downloads and a glimpse inside the after hours work at Microsoft. One to watch.  <!--
