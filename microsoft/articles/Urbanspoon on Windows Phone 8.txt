One of the apps I’ve coveted the most from iPhone is Urbanspoon so I can hardly believe that I missed its arrival on Windows Phone 8. Joe Belfiore mentioned it was coming soon back in October at the Windows Phone 8 launch but I only spotted it about 2 weeks ago.It has all the features I enjoyed on iPhone, most notably the shake option to play the restaurant lottery. I locked in South Lake Union and shook for my first test…and predictably my first shake resulted in a recommendation for The Brave Horse Tavern (aka, my local).It’s a great app with a database of over 800,000 restaurants. It’s available now in the marketplace for free.
