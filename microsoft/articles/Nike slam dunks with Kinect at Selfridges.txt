Selfridges in London has always had great window displays – last summer they upped the ante with some Kinect magic courtesy of Dutch creative agency …,staat who designed 8 interactive displays to coincide with the Olympics. The displays featured Nike’s Flyknit Racer, Nike+ Fuelband, Lunarglide, Reflective Sportswear and the Pinnacle clothing line.In the image above you can see a pair of Kinect sensors that tracked passers by and animated the scene in the window based on their movement.Another display used Kinect to promote the Hyperdunk basketball shoe by having you stand on the street and jump as high as you could on a blue circle.The intersection of fashion and tech isn’t just limited to the wearable computing trend we’re hearing a lot about right now – it’s interesting across the whole retail industry.
