What can I say, it’s Friday and there is another Forza Motorsport video on deck. The TopGear Car Pack is arriving on Tuesday, May 1st, and 560 MS points will get you the following cars. Stick with the video until the end to see some impressive driving of the 2011 Ford Transit SuperSportVan. Personally though, I’m looking forward to driving the 1966 Lotus CortinaTweet
