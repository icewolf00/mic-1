Another Friday, another Forza Motorsport video. As much as I like the videos showing the upcoming car packs (last week I highlighted the TopGear Car pack), these “making of” videos are the ones I really enjoy. They give some real insight into the craftsmanship that has gone in to Forza Motorsport 4.This video focuses on the unique partnership between Turn 10 Studios and Pirelli to refine and perfect the tire performance model in the game. Tire physics is a complex topic so Turn 10 worked with reams of tire data from the Pirelli R&D environment and asked them to employ custom tests to get the amazing levels of insight that can then be applied to deliver a better, more realistic driving experience.Tweet
