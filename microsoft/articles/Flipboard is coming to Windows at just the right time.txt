 On the occasions I’ve used an iPad at a friends house or played with one in a retail store, the one app I always end up playing with is Flipboard. As a relentless reader of hundreds of blogs I’ve always admire the way it can turn what I typically read as a sea of news in to an engaging magazine like experience complete with social integration for Twitter and Facebook. So when I heard Flipboard is coming to Windows I did a little back-flip.And now Flipboard has published a small teaser video that shows how well suited their app is to Windows. I can’t wait to test it out and with the demise of Google Reader today, the timing couldn’t be better for me.
