At TechForum in late February I shared a video regarding a Microsoft Research project called Illumishare and it got picked up quite widely – no surprise as it showed a prototype that enables remote users to share any physical or digital object on any surface. I recently found two other videos that give a different look at Illumishare. The first, shown above, looks at the gaming potential as two kids show many of the  the things they could do with the prototype.The third video, shot at our TechFest event a few weeks following TechForum, shows a further development of Illumishare to enable a remote meeting attendee on a digital device, such as a slate or tablet PC, to interact with a physical whiteboard in the meeting conference room.Tweet
