It’s been a long time coming but Carbon for Windows Phone is now available. I’ve been using it for a while now thanks to Moe and it’s the slickest of all the Twitter clients I’ve used. It makes great use of Live Tiles, it’s fast and it has a great metro look. It also has multi account support, read later and inline images..and the developers promise push notifications very soon. Oh and threaded direct messages is a welcome feature too.Well worth the $1.99 IMHO…grab it from the marketplace and expect an updated on Feb 15th to v1.2 with these features/fixes Congrats to the Carbon team!Tweet
