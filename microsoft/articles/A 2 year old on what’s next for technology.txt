Of all the posts in this weeks’ retrospective, a post titled What my daughter taught me about the future of technology is the most recent and was probably the most fun (and challenging) to write. The most fun as it involved recording my 2 year old daughter shouting at our Xbox. The most challenging as editorial approval from my wife was harder than from our product teams!Have a listen and take a read to get a real world look in to why natural user interfaces are the way of the future, and will be expected by generation Z (and whatever comes after Gen Z).Tweet
