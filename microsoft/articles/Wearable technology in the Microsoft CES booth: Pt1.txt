We’ve shown The Printing Dress before here on Next at Microsoft but this week it’s getting its first public outing at CES. In the What’s Next booth visitors can take a look at the creation from Asta Roseway and Sheridan Martin and get a sense of what wearable computing may look like in the future. It’s a delicate item though so there is no trying on…but elsewhere in the booth we’ve resolved that with Kinect. Stay tuned for our next video to see how.If you’re at CES be sure to drop by to see first hand the dress that won Best Concept and Best in Show at International Symposium on Wearable Computers in San Francisco last year.Tweet
