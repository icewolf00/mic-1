I see my pal Derek Snyder posted a blog earlier today signaling that Skype for Windows Phone is no longer a beta app â€“ the team have released an official version of the app to the Windows Phone Marketplace â€“ along with a brief video shown above that gives you a tour.As the blog notes, some new features have been added that were not in the beta including video calling in portrait mode and friend management capabilities such as invite, accept invitations, block, and unblock contacts. You can grab it by scanning the QR or Microsoft Tag below.Props to Tom Warren for being first out of bed with this one on a Sunday. Â ðŸ™‚Tweet
