For all its potential to do good, the Internet has also given rise to some very dastardly things as well, as Rane Johnson pointed out yesterday on the Official Microsoft Blog. To help turn the tables, Microsoft Research Connections and the Imagine Cup team are working  with NCWIT and a handful of other organizations for the first International Women’s Hackathon.Part of the focus will be on how the Internet can be used to protect women from human trafficking, or to help victim’s find their freedom. In the process, hopefully a few young women will move more toward careers in the critical fields of science, technology, engineering and math.Rane’s blog post provides more details about the hackathon and this video gives some background about the  work we do with NCWIT and the Anita Borg Institute, among others
