Last year we published a short video with me touring the Microsoft Home – shown above – it’s a facility we have on our main campus in Redmond that explores what technology may be commonplace in homes in the next 5-10 years. For that reason it’s not a Jetsons like place and is much more grounded in what real homes may look like and how technology may be woven in to them.With woven in mind, I got thinking about yesterday’s post on the blending of the physical and digital with respect to the Microsoft Home. I was there last week and with this new terminology in my mind, it cast some of the demos in a new light for me. Here are some of the examples where the physical elements of the home blend with digital technology.   There are several other examples in the home but these are a few that helped me go beyond thinking of the blending of physical and digital as a synonym for augmented reality. What I also found interesting about these examples is the seamless way they’re woven in to the home – they don’t feel clunky in the way some AR applications I’ve used are. This is a big part of why I think the blending of physical and digital is closely tied to another trend I’ve talked about a lot on this blog – natural user interfaces. The more we can weave digital and physical in seamless ways such as those in the home, the more natural the interactions will be and more importantly, the more likely we are to accept and adopt them as commonplace.Tweet
