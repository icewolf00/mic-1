I’ve been playing with the new version of the Bing translator app for a few weeks and there is a lot to like. It provides image to text translation, voice translation and text entry translation. I used it yesterday in a French restaurant to translate parts of the menu I didn’t understand and it worked a treat.The app also includes an offline translation mode, whereby you download language packs and thus avoid data charges while traveling. All in all, a very versatile useful app whether you’re traveling, eating foreign foods or simply looking to impress your friends.Grab it now from the marketplaceIn related news, the same translation technology has recently been deployed on the Kindle Touch to provide instant translation.Tweet
