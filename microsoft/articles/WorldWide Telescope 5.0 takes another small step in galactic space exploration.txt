Since its initial release in 2008, the WorldWide Telescope (WWT) has provided what is arguably one of the best examples of blending rich data sets with an incredibly stunning visual experience. This week, the team behind the WWT is marking its fifth anniversary with the availability of version 5.0.  With this release, you can add more of a cinematic feel to your galactic tours. You can even import 3D models to create a more immersive experience, and it comes preloaded with several 3D models, such as one of the International Space Station.Jonathan Fay elaborated on the details of the new release on the Microsoft Research Connections blog. Better yet, download the latest version of the WWT and see for yourself.
