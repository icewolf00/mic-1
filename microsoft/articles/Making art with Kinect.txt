 Another project by James Alliban that uses Kinect for an art installation – this time in West Bromwich in England.Commissioned by The Public, James created a piece that encourages passers-by to become performer and composer. Kinect captures their movement and translates it in to abstract moving art that continues for the duration of their movement and slowly fades back to black after they’ve moved away. The resulting art is accompanied by music from David Kamp. As part of the Art of Motion exhibition earlier this year at The Public it’s another example of how Kinect is being used in many more ways than we ever expected.If you missed James’s other project last week, check out Cell: A Kinect art installation that mirrors your online persona
