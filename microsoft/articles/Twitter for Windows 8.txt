Twitter for Windows 8 is here. Announced today on the Twitter blog the app has some pretty sweet features – I’ve been using for a few days and really like snap view in particular. Live tiles and  notifications are also part of the experience and there is integration with the search charm.  It’s clean, elegant and ready for you now in the Windows Store. Props to Mike Kruzeniski (@mkruz) and the team at Twitter. Have at it and read more on the Windows blog.
