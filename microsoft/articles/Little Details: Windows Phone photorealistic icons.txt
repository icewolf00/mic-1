 It’s been a while since I posted a Little Details so this is another one I like. When you have a Windows Phone 8 device connected to Windows 8, you get a photorealistic icon in Windows Explorer. The image above is from my own PC with my HTC 8x connected. I was thinking it’d be even cooler if the screen showed my home screen – a feature request for the WP team perhaps…And just to show you this isn’t HTC specific, here’s the image from my Nokia Lumia 920.
