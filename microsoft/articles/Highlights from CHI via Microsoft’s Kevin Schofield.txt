I managed to catch up with Kevin Schofield from Microsoft Research this week – he’s just back from last week’s CHI conference in Vancouver. Of course he had a lot more to say about the conference than can be summed up in a half-hour conversation, let alone a brief blog post, but here are some of his highlights: image credit: Alex Madrigal, The Atlantic  Conferences like these are a fantastic opportunity for people working in different fields to get together, share their ideas and generate brilliant insights and inspirations from the crossing of those streams. We’re proud that Microsoft plays a strong role in supporting CHI and this kind of intellectual exchange in general.Tweet
