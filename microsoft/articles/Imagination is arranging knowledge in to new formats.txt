A fine quote by Syd Mead, the concept designer behind Blade Runner, Aliens, and Tron. In the video above he gives his view on robots, transportation and imagination in 2019. It’s a cool little video and his thesis is centered around notion of human intellect, curiosity and creativity driving the future. We have our own 2019 video here at Microsoft and many of the things you see in the video we’ll feature here on Next over the coming weeks.  Tweet
