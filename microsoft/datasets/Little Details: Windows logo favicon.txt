The first in a new series of occasional posts on NEXT that I’m calling “Little Details”. It’s inspired by the Little Big Details blog and focuses on the attention to detail in our products.First up is the new Microsoft logo being sported as a favicon for Microsoft.com, Microsoft News Center and the Microsoft Store. A little detail for sure, but good to see.If you have suggestions for future posts on this topic, send them in the comments or to @stevecla on Twitter
