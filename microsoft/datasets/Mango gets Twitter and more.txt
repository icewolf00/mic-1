In a post on the Windows Phone blog last week, Andy Myers echoes my own anticipation, and concerns, about Twitter integration in Windows Phone 7.5 (aka Mango). Like Andy, I was worried that integrating my Twitter fire hose in to the phone UI was going to be akin to wrapping your mouth around a real fire hose. A tricky proposition. Thankfully, it’s a far more pleasant experience and rather than re-hash Andy’s fine post, I’ll point you to Tweet-ness! How Twitter works in Mango.I will say that I love the Me Card and how that now animates as a live tile with notifications of Twitter mentions and other social updates. The video above shows this integration along with more of the animations on the home screen and within groups etc. – it’s proven to have at least a few of my iPhone toting friends looking on enviously and saying that Windows Phone somehow just feels more “alive”.Tweet
