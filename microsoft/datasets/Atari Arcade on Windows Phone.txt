Catching up on my blog reading this week I spotted a post from Michael Stroh on the Windows Phone blog that highlighted the capability of IE10 on Windows Phone 8. In particular I noticed a reference to Atari Arcade.Surely you can’t play game such as Pong and Missile Command through a browser on a phone? Surely you can. Check out Atari Arcade from your phone and prepare to lose at least 15 minutes immediately as you get sucked in to classic game in your palm.
