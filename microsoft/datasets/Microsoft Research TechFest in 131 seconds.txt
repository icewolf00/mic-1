The video doesn’t really do TechFest justice in that there is so much more to see than can be captured in a little over 2 minutes – in fact if you want to see more of the actual demos, check out other posts this week on the blog. For a snapshot of what TechFest is all about though, this is a great little video. The money quote for me? Nearly every product that Microsoft ships includes technology transfer from Microsoft Research. <!--
