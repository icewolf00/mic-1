This site isn’t exactly Engadget so a hardware review isn’t normally my thing – but with a trio of new devices in the Clayton Manor, it seemed time to offer up some views on the hardware.I’ve been playing with the Samsung Series 9 laptop, the Microsoft Touch Mouse and the new Microsoft Comfort Curve Keyboard 3000. First up is the Samsung Series 9 laptop – specifically I have the 900X3A model which is the original 13” unit. I say original as even though it’s less than 3 moths old, the chaps at Samsung recently announced a new model with an Intel Core i7 and 6GB of RAM as well as updating the 11” model with a 128GB solid state drive. The aforementioned Engadget has all of the details.So what’s my take on the Samsung? I’ll keep it simple with some pro’s and con’s. If you ever want more in depth reviews of the latest and greatest PC’s, look no further than my buddy Ben “The PC Guy” Rudolph. Pro’s Cons’s In summary, it’s an outstanding PC, probably the best I have owned and it’s replaced the Lenovo x301 as my main machine – which takes some doing. The Samsung is fast, stylish, light and incredibly well built and packs in a ton of technology in to a small space. Much like myself…ahem.Tweet
