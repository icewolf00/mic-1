Science and science fiction have always had a symbiotic relationship, and on Tuesday, Microsoft is releasing a fiction anthology that brings the two together.“Future Visions: Original Science Fiction Inspired by Microsoft,” featuring writers including Ann Leckie, Robert J. Sawyer, Greg Bear, David Brin and Nancy Kress, is available to anyone as a free download.“The idea was to bring authors in to expose them to what some people might think is science fiction. In a way, you could say the world of Microsoft Research turns science fiction into science fact,” says Steve Clayton, chief storyteller at Microsoft. “We didn’t show them a piece of technology and ask them to please write about that. We showed them technology and introduced them to a group of people, and then asked them, what did it spark in your mind as ideas, where did it inspire you to think the technology may go?”Read the full story at the Microsoft News Center.
