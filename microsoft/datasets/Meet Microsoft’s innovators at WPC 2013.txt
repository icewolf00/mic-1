Worldwide Partner Conference remains my favorite event on the Microsoft calendar of events. I personally get a ton of value from meeting partners – the people who are out there selling Microsoft products and services every day and therefore a able to give me real insight in to how products are selling, what the key questions from customers are and how Microsoft is perceived.For the last few years, I’ve had the pleasure of helping with the event, with the morning pre-show and last year during the keynotes with a series of ‘what’s next’ demos. This year I’ll be bringing something different to the keynote stage.My day job at Microsoft means I get to meet the brightest minds at the company who are thinking about and building the future of technology. People such as Stevie Bathiche who leads Microsoft’s Applied Sciences Group and Lili Cheng who leads FUSE Labs, part of Microsoft Research. During the day 3 keynote, I’ll host Stevie, Lili and a few other innovators on stage to share their work and show you another side of Microsoft. As always, I’ll have a few surprises in store with some never seem before technology so I hope you can make it.It promises to be another amazing WPC – I’ll see you there.
