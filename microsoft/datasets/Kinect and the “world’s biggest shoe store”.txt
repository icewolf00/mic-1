&amp;amp;#160;As a man who has more footwear than he’d care to admit to, I don’t know if this is a good thing or a bad thing – a Kinect for Windows powered virtual shoe store. In fact, the creators, Gortz, claim this is the world’s largest shoe store.The system premiered at Hamburg Central Station recently and employs 3 Kinect sensors to allow you to choose a brand and style of shoe and then have them digitally slipped on to your feet. As befits such as a social activity, you can post images of the shoe fitting to Facebook and buy via your phone with a QR code displayed on screen.Share
