We just announced that Windows Phone Mango has hit RTM (release to manufacture) – which means it’s done and we’re sending it to our handset and mobile operator partners to get it in to the hands of customers.Having used it for the last few months and enjoyed the latest updates last week on my own phone, I think people will love it. Sure there are over 500 new features but what I really love about Mango is the attention to detail. The little things like groups in contacts, faster access to apps with intelligent searching and history of all my actions with people (or groups).Tasty stuff – Stuart Bottom talks about some of this in the new video above from the Windows Phone team. I learned some new stuff from the video.Check out the other videos in this series Tweet
