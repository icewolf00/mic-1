Our friends at Channel 9 have started posting interviews and clips from the upcoming documentary “Ctrl+Alt+Compete,” which will be released Nov. 9. The film looks at the startup and emerging business scene through the eyes of five entrepreneurs and their teams, plus it offers insight and analysis from seasoned tech industry observers and pioneers. Three videos are up so far, interviews with Micah Baldwin of Graphic.ly, Tim O’Reilly, and Simon Sinek. Here Sinek talks about what distinguishes a company with a truly good idea from one that doesn’t quite have what it takes.I think “Ctrl+Alt+Compete” is a cool concept – developed by Ten100 in partnership with Microsoft to offer viewers a glimpse of the kinds of visionary ideas that bring success — a rare thing in the entrepreneurial realm.In related news, Jay Greene takes a look behind the scenes today with Channel 9 over on Cnet.Tweet
