AT&T announced pricing and availability for the Nokia Lumia 900 earlier today – it’s coming to the US starting on April 8th and will run atop AT&T’s 4G LTE network. As happy as I am with my Lumia 800, that 4G speed may see me make the move to the 900. It’s coming in at $99.99 and I may hold out for the white version, arriving on April 22. All the detail are on the Microsoft News Center and the Windows Phone blog.Pre-orders are available in cyan or black beginning March 30 from www.att.com/lumiaTweet
