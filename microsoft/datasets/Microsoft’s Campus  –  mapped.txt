[click the image for a birds eye view with Photosynth overlays]During this week you’ve gotten to see just a few places on Microsoft Campus and over the next weeks and months I’ll endeavor to show you more – with photographs, videos and Photosynth’s. My dream is to have some sort of Willy Wonka style golden ticket draw where a few folks who read the blog get to come to Redmond and I take them on what I call the underground tour. In the meantime, I’ve been asked Softies to geotag photographs they have on to Bing Maps to help give you a view inside of Redmond. I also asked for Photosynth’s to add to the Visitor Center one I created. There are a few already – one of the Microsoft Company Store for example and another impressive synth of the piece of Berlin Wall that sits inside Building 33.Take a Photosynth view of Microsoft Campus.I hope you enjoyed the week of places – please post any feedback in the comments on other places you’d like to see either here in Redmond or around the Microsoft world. // <![CDATA[
