A new, interactive platform, the Microsoft Prediction Lab, has launched as a website-based showcase and laboratory for the ongoing work of David Rothschild, a Microsoft researcher and leading expert in a new kind of data-driven predictive methodology.This interactive platform houses all of the predictive efforts Rothschild has been featuring on his blog and in academic journals and presentations. Microsoft Prediction Lab displays his predictions — some of them updated in real time — in a wide range of fields, from sports and entertainment to politics and economics.Rothschild sees the new platform as “a great laboratory for researchers” as well as “a very socialized experience” for interested users. Among other contests, he plans to predict the results of every upcoming U.S. House, Senate, and gubernatorial race. Users will be able to customize views on the site based on their geographic location and their interests. The idea is to collect data quickly and update it as often as possible.Head over to Microsoft Research for more information about the Microsoft Prediction Lab.Athima Chansanchai
