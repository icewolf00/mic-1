Nice work by the boys down under – our DPE team in Australia. They sent me a link to Noise to Signal this week. Long Zheng beat me to this one…of course. It’s an interactive cartoon with a lot of fun elements and links out to useful site. They cover Kinect, IE9, Windows Phone and more and their legal disclaimer was a highlight….and perhaps even a small “in joke”….but I’m just speculating.   Fine work from Michael Kordahi – also behind the sister site at http://9by9.tv which asks 9 smart people the same 9 questions and allows you to play the answers back in any order and choose given what’s most relevant to you.<!--
