 It’s been a while since I wrote about Microsoft Tag – but that doesn’t mean I’m not still on the lookout for cool uses of the digital recognition technology. The latest use I found is  graphic design project from Meta Menkveld titled “Everything is corn”. it’s an homage to the fact that almost every product we eat is dependent on corn.The project blends art and technology with a series of Tag images that are all visually corn related – and all digital. Because each image is a Tag they can be scanned with a smartphone for additional information.A wonderful concept, beautifully executed.via Microsoft Tag blog
