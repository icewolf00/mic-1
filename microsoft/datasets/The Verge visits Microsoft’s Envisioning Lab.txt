The next installment from the recent Underground Tour I hosted with Josh Topolosky and Chad Mumm of The Verge just posted on their site. This time, it’s a look inside The Envisioning Lab at Microsoft, with my buddy Harald Becker. Josh gets to play with a 28ft touch screen wall as well as some of the prototypes in the lab including a multiscreen desk and a Microsoft Research project known as OmniTouch. Cigars and single malt whisky optional…Another great video from the team at The Verge – they do a terrific editing job of adding solid music and in this video, splicing in some content from the 2009 vision video from the Microsoft Office team to give context to a few of the demos.
