Last August I posted about Building four on our main campus here in Redmond undergoing a serious refresh – now one of the teams who lives there has done the same with their website.Office Labs are the team behind the future vision videos you may also have seen on this blog but that’s just a small part of their work. They focus on an array of projects ranging from the prototyping of concepts, to longer-term incubations – working with many other groups across Microsoft. The new site has a fresh, clean look and gives you more details on the work in the lab that the team is focused and some great views in to the world of their work. Oh and they’re hiring!Head to office.com/labs to check out the new site.Tweet
