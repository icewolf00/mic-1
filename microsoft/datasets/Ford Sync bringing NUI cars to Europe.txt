Just a quick post to acknowledge the announcement at CeBIT today that Ford SYNC is coming to Europe. Over 3 million customers are using SYNC in cars in North America and now Europe is about to get the NUI goodness too. What do I mean by that? The ability to control your entertainment and connectivity systems with your voice. I recently saw a video showing an in car system controlled by gesture and almost fell of my chair laughing. It’s all about the right input mechanism for the situation (hint: mice and keyboards are not going away). In a car, your voice is arguably the best way to control your systems while maintaining control. I got a full on demo of this recently and it was pretty cool stuff. If you get chance, wander down to your local Ford dealer and ask them for a demo.[bonus link] a comprehensive look at in car tech from Mashable<!--
