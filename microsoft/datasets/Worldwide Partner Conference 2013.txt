Steve Clayton - Editor - Microsoft News Center Staff

Once again I find myself on the road in July at our annual Worldwide Partner Conference in Houston, Texas. This event brings over 15,000 Microsoft Partners together for a week to celebrate their success and share our direction for the year ahead. I spent the morning in the Toyota Center hearing from Steve Ballmer, Tami Reller and Satya Nadella. You can check out the on demand keynote already and I’d urge you to check out Steve Ballmer’s keynote for a great overview of Cloud, Mobility, Social and Big Data as well as a great set of demos during Satya’s keynote – and of course an epic demo of Windows 8.1 including some never seen before features.Be sure to tune in to the day 3 keynote too when you’ll see the ‘innovators session I have lined up.
