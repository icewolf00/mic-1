One of the most compelling examples of the Internet of Things is the whole concept behind the smart city, where virtually everything within the critical infrastructure is connected and generates or consumes data. Wired had a great article on smart cities a few weeks ago and we’ve seen some pretty cool examples of what this might look like in last few months, like NYC’s phone booth of the future. Now Breakfast, a New York design firm, has re-imagined the analog directional sign and retrofitted it with some pretty amazing engineering and technology. Their creation features 16,000 LEDs, more than 11 gears that make each sign spin smoothly and  independently, and the ability to connect to virtually any data feed. A tip of the hat to my friends at PSFK.
