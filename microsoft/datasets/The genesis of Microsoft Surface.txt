A bit of nostalgia for a Friday – a video of the first prototype of Microsoft Surface. Cool to see even then the team was demonstrating stuff such as digital objects showing physical properties and multi user multi touch. We see objects that light up objects as analog ‘knobs’ to control the UI. Oh and remote control tanks that are tracked …and now we have Surface 2.0 – a 4” thin screen with pixels that see instead of cameras. <!--
