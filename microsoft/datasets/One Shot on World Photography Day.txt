Today is World Photography Day – a day to celebrate photography, which is certainly what I have been doing of late with my Nokia Lumia 1020. And most recently with a new application called One Shot.What I love about this app are the real-time filter effects you can apply when taking a photo – some of which you can see above. I hear it was built using Nokia’s Imaging SDK which may explain why it’s so slick.So on a day to take photos, give this one a shot…and check out the competition our friends at Bing have just kicked off with Discovery. The winner will also receive a new Nokia Lumia 1020, 500px membership and canvas of the winning photo.
