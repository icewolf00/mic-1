 Earlier this week I had the chance to moderate a panel of luminaries on the topic of natural user interface at the 2012 Seattle Interactive Conference. The all star lineup included …as well as our own Oscar Murillo, user experience architect for Kinect for Windows. Oscar kicked off the session with a primer on the transformational power of voice and gesture technology and a wicked demonstration that showed participants how much the Kinect sensor has grown beyond its gaming roots.You can read more about what the panel discussed on the Kinect for Windows blog and I hope to have Oscar’s demo captured on video soon to show you here on NEXT.
