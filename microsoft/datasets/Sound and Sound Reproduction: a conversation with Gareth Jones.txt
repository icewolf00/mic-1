The third in a series of beautiful videos from in Microsoft UK’s developer evangelism team. Inspired by Metro, Andrew Spooner and the team are quite taken with all elements of design and I’m all for that if it results in videos like this.Gareth Jones is a record producer who has worked with Depeche Mode and Erasure. In this 5 minute film he talks about how he hears the world, the loudness war and offers up some advice on how to produce sounds that work well on small speakers of the kind we have in modern mobile phones.Enjoy!Tweet
