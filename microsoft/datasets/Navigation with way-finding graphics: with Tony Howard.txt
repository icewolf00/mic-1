Another beautiful video in the design series from my friends in Microsoft UK’s developer evangelism team.As you may know, the Metro style that you see in Windows Phone, Xbox and Windows 8 is heavily influenced by way-finding graphics from airports, railway stations etc. I was in London recently and notice more and more how simple and clear the graphics are in these environment. There is no adornment, or “chrome”, as it’s called. Just simple, elegant signage that works for most people regardless of spoken language.In this latest video from Andrew Spooner, Tony Howard, the Managing Director of the London based Transport Design Consultancy discusses his approach to way-finding signage. Tony has worked as Head of Design at British Rail and his recent projects include the branding and signing projects for Sydney Metro, Bangalore Metro, St Pancras International, Bengaluru International airport and in Dubai, advising on graphics, signing and brand strategy for Dubai’s public transport system, including metro, tram, marine and airport rail services. Perfectly well placed then to talk about way-finding.Tweet
