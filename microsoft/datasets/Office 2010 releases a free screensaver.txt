Remember the days of flying toasters? No, probably not…I’m showing my age. Back when I started my career in IT, your screensaver said a lot about you. Now, it says you’re not working hard enough!Nevertheless, screen savers are still an art form and the Office team has just released the Office 2010 “Getting Started” Screensaver. This free screensaver automatically downloads 60-90 second video tips from Office.com and displays them when you’re not using your PC. The video above is one example.Check out more on the Office Blog or download now.Tweet
