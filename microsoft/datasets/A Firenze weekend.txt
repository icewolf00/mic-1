I’m working this weekend – well, sorta. I’m going to be on our Redmond Campus from 9-5 on Saturday and Sunday observing the finals of Firenze. I covered Firenze on this site a few weeks ago, explaining that it’s a competition that seeks to bring together expertise from Business, Design and Technology. Five US universities are competing, working on real world Microsoft problems. Oh and they’re competing for 20 grand in cash too……Giorgio Vanzini just signed that off and the video below shows what’s in store over the weekend. I’ll be posting photos on Flickr and tweeting under the hashtag #firenzebxt <!--
