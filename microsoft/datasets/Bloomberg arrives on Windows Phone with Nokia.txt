 It’s been a while since I highlighted a new Windows Phone app I’m enjoying but the new Bloomberg app for Windows Phone is worthy of post. It’s exclusively for Nokia Lumia phones and is free to users of those phones. That’s impressive given the amount of work that appears to have gone in to this app.It’s a comprehensive tool for the business professional on the go but also the savvy consumer who wants to keep up with the latest news and track the markets. The level of customization means it can adapt well to my needs which center around tech news, a few stocks and world news. Though I haven’t had chance to explore, the app also includes audio and video content from Bloomberg TV and Bloomberg Radio – which means Charlie Rose on the go! Download the app by scanning this QR code with your Lumia (full instructions if you need them) Share
