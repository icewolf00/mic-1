Back in March I wrote a post on the Official Microsoft Blog about the collaboration between our products teams and Microsoft Research. The infographic has had a second lease of life this week as it was included in a story on the Microsoft News Center regarding Avatar Kinect and I noticed The Windows Club and Visual Loop picked up the image so I thought I’d share again.The backdrop to this infographic was an attempt to explain the R&D investment Microsoft makes each year and the balance of research vs. development – something I characterized at small r BIG D. Of the total investment, a relatively small amount goes in to research compared to development. In Microspeak, development = products you see shipping such as Windows, Office, Kinect, SQL, Exchange, Bing etc etc. If you’ve not see the infographic before, here’s the full version – click for a higher res image.
