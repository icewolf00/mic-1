Following the demo and discussion at the D Conference yesterday, Mike Angiulo took to the stage at Computex to show off a range of devices running Windows 8 and gave some details on the hardware design points. I found this slide particularly interesting which led me to head off and read up on UEFI – a firmware interface specification that should lead to faster boot times. I’ve talked a lot in the past on this blog about NUI and sensors, both of which get a nod in the slide too – anyway, check out the video above, plenty more interesting stuff to learn.
