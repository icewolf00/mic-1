The Surface Windows 8 Pro hits the shelves tomorrow and a lot of people have been talking about it. So it makes perfect sense that the Surface team would want to get in on the conversation. Yesterday, they did.For the initial post of the Surface blog, general manager Panos Panay talked up the hardware experience of the Surface RT and Surface Pro, along with some of the Windows 8 apps. Personally, I really love the IHeartRadio app for listening to stations back home, and with the pen input in Surface Pro, Fresh Paint is sure to remain near the top of my list.As David Pogue said in his review, Surface Pro delivers something that’s “almost a new category.” The design team put a lot of great thinking into Surface and I can’t wait to learn about what else is in store.
