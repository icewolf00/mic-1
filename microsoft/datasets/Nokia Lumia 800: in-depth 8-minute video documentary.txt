8 minutes of goodness on the Nokia Lumia 800 design process. Shot at Nokia’s London design studio with Stefan Pannenbecker, VP of Industrial Design at Nokia, Chris Linnett, Head of Lumia UX design and Kate Freebairn, Creative Director for Lumia UX design, the videos to expose the story behind the creation of the Lumia 800.I still haven’t got my hands on the device itself but a trip to the UK in just over a week should solve that. In the meantime, this beautifully shot video gives you a great look at the hardware and the philosophy of the design.  It’s interesting to hear how much focus went in to antenna design and how the curved screen complements the panoramic design of Windows Phone.Tweet
