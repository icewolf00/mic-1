We’re closing in on D-Day (DEMO day that is) for the 11 startups involved in the the Microsoft Accelerator for Kinect. That’s on June 28th and I’ll be there to see how the teams fare as they pitch their ideas to investors, reporters and tech luminaries.I’ve been spending a good amount of time checking in on the teams at our Seattle Westlake office and you can too in this latest video that introduces you to the companies and what they’re developing. The video only captures some of the buzz in the Microsoft office space they’ve taken over and since the first time I visited a month or so ago, I’ve been telling everyone to go visit – there’s just a great energy and camaraderie about what they’re all building together with the Kinect technology.June 28th should be a lot of fun/stress/beers/cheers. Stay tuned.Tweet
