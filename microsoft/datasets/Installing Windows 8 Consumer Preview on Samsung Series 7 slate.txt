A few of my friends have been so enamored by my Samsung Series 7 slate running the Windows 8 Consumer Preview that they’ve gone out and bought one themselves. Of course it comes pre-loaded with Windows 7 so those same friends have been asking me how they should load the Consumer Preview on to the device. Fortunately for me (and them) Samsung has a website dedicated to just that.The site includes an installation guide, back and restore guidance as well as drivers for the touch screen and rotation sensor.Fine work from the Samsung folks…and if you’re looking for advice on system recommendations for running the Consumer Preview, a recent Building Windows 8 blog post has lots of solid advice. thanks to Rob Margel for the tip on this.Tweet
