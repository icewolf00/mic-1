As you may have seen or read, Internet Explorer is coming to Xbox 360 and I couldn’t have said it better than Gizmodo so I wont try …..the new Xbox 360 dashboard update looks like Windows Phone 8 which looks like Windows 8 which looks like Outlook which looks like Surface which looks like Xbox which looks like, well, Microsoft. Yep, it looks kind of familiar. I for one love the consistency we’re seeing in typography, navigation, iconography, language, palette and more across so many of our products.
