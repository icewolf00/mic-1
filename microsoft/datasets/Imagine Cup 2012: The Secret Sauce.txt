 While in Toronto this week for WPC, I had the chance to talk with some of our partners about the amazing stuff they’re doing with things such as Windows 8 and the Kinect for Windows SDK. Meanwhile, a group of around 350 students in Sydney were showing off some of the amazing things they’ve done as part of the Imagine Cup finals. The winning team of the software design competition built a custom-designed sensory glove and smartphone app. Together, they translate a deaf person’s sign language gestures into verbal speech. Yet another cool example of blending the physical and the virtual. Check out The Imagine Cup Newsroom for more on the winning teams.Tweet
