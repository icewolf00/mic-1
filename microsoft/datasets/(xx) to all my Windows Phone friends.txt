Following on the heels of the first set of Windows Phone emoticons, Michael Stroh has published a second set on the Windows Phone blog. That turtle is going to come in so handy  ….oh and as Michael points out, bear in mind that these character combos might call up different images (or none at all) if you send them to people not using Windows Phone 7.5 or Windows Live Messenger.As for me, I’m busy sending all of my friends (xx) today to remind them to get their Xbox 360 dashboard update.Tweet
