Back in April I posted about Nissan’s use of Kinect for Windows at the Chicago auto show to give prospective customers a look inside the 2013 Pathfinder – that created so much interest that Nissan took it to 16 dealerships in 13 US states. As John Brancheau, vice president of marketing at Nissan North America says on the Kinect for Windows blog: “It’s a powerful pre-sales tool that has the potential to revolutionize the dealer experience.”  You can see the Nissan Pathfinder app in action at one of the 16 participating dealerships and in the video above. Nissan are not alone in this shift of the dealership experience. Earlier this month I highlighted Audi’s innovative use of Kinect to reimagine their showroom experience and Ford has a similar program underway in Europe for their B-MAX.    The Kinect for Windows program isn’t even a year old and already blue chip companies are finding innovative ways to use the sensor and SDK. As I’ve noted before, this is just scratching the surface and there is much more to come from the auto and many other industries. I spoke with the Kinect for Windows team recently and they updated me on a few other projects we’ll share here soon – you’ll be surprised by a few!Share
