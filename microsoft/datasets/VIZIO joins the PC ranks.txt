I’m catching up on things here but, whoa, VIZIO just entered the Windows PC market with a stunning line of PCs. These guys are the No. 1 maker of LCD HDTVs in the United States and they make some stunning products. Now they’ve added ultra-thin notebooks, a laptop and two desktop computers to their lineup. As you can see from the images, they’ve got a premium design and they’ve worked with Microsoft to combine that with a great experience based on the Microsoft Signature Experience for Windows 7-based PCs. Of course every VIZIO PC will be eligible for an upgrade to Windows 8 Pro as part of the Windows Upgrade Offer.Check out the lineup at VIZIO.com, the Microsoft Store or retailers such as Wal-Mart, Sam’s Club or Costco near you.Tweet
