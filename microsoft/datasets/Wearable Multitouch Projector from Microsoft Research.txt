I’ve learned to track the work for Hrvoje Benko from Microsoft Research quite closely. He’s been involved in projects such as MirageTable, LightSpace, Pinch-the-Sky Dome and products such as the Microsoft Touch Mouse.This week at TechFest, he’s been showing his latest project. The Wearable Multitouch Projector allows a user to use their hands, arms or the wall as graphical interactive surfaces. As you can see in the video, this is still very much at the prototype stage but the potential is clear – with anything you can do on today’s mobile devices, potentially being in the palm of a hand.Tweet
