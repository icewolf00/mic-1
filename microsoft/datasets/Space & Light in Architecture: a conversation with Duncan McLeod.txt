The third in a series of four videos by Microsoft UK’s developer evangelism team – architect Duncan McLeod shared his thoughts and opinions on the subject of space. Not in a Star Trek, final frontier kind of way – in the architecture kind of way and whether that translates to digital content. It’s all part of a series of Metro inspired short films from Andrew Spooner.If you missed the earlier two be sure to check outand come back next week for the final film.Enjoy!Tweet
