 I’ll admit that Forza Horizon has yet to grace the screen of Casa Clayton yet during this festive season – but it will, and I’ll be driving a 1983 GMC Vandura G-1500. That’s right, the Vandura is the van of vans. It’s going to have a hard time keeping up with some of the other motors in the January Recaro Car Pack.The 2012 Lexus LFA Nürburgring Edition is quite a rare car but not as rare of the 2009 Pagani Zonda Cinque Roadster. Only five of the roadsters were built and they’re good for 217 mph.The pack will be available on Jan 1st 2013.
