Sitting in front of the television watching The Killing this weekend I did what I routinely do when the adverts come on – skipped past them as I was watching time delayed. That may all change with the advent of NUads.In October last year I mentioned NUads here on NEXT – a new interactive TV ad format that transforms the traditional 30 second TV spot in to engaging experiences using Kinect for Xbox 360. Toyota, Unilever and Samsung Mobile USA are the first brands to develop NUads campaigns that will appear on Xbox LIVE later this year – the video above gives you a sneak peek of what’s to come. Toyota will be using the format with a “Reinvented” ad that asks viewers what they would like to see reinvented – and viewers can respond using Kinect-powered voice or gesture controls.Lynx in the UK is also taking to the NUads format with a cops and robbers spot. The tagline, ‘Nothing will ever be the same again’ sees Lynx asking the audience if we should give the Lynx Effect to girls. Viewers have the option of voting ‘Yes, of course’ or ‘No way’ using hand gestures.NUads brings a dimension to advertising that’s been something of a holy grail – interaction and reaction from viewers in what is traditionally a passive environment. I think it’s a great example of the capabilities of the Xbox LIVE platform, Kinect and the real beauty of natural user interaction. I’m now eager to see the creative work of the advertising world show us what they can do with the format and their reaction at Cannes Lions next week. I’ll be there, reporting from the beach (literally).Find out more at advertising.microsoft.com/gaming/xbox-live and follow the action from Cannes on TwitterTweet
