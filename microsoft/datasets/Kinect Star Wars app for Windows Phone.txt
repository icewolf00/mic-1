I’m not sure how this one slipped past me last week but what’s not to like about having your tweets displayed in Star Wars opening credit style? That’s precisely what the Kinect Star Wars for Windows Phone enables.This free application from Microsoft Studios opens with the note that “this is the social networking app you’ve been looking for” and promptly helps you to connect to Facebook and Twitter. A quick flip of your phone in to landscape mode and that memorable opening scene music from Star Wars kicks in and your tweets scroll by. It’s shockingly addictive.You can of course tweet and update your status from the app but that scrolling feature makes me want to go out and buy a stand for my Lumia 800.Download nowTweet
