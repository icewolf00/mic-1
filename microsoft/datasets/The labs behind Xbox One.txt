One of the best parts of my job is the Underground Tours I host here at Microsoft HQ in Redmond. Last week, I got to go on a tour myself of some hidden spots behind the Xbox business. CNN captured some footage from some of them – check out the hardware test lab with robots and game pad simulator in particular. I got to spend some time in there and hope to be back soon to show you more.
