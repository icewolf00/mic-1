I’m a big fan of TED – who isn’t? What I didn’t know is they have an Ads Worth Spreading challenge that seeks to find ads that “communicate ideas with consumers in the same way that TED wants to communicate with its audience”. Their ten winners were revealed at the conference in Long Beach this week and it was great to see our Kinect Effect ad was a winner. I never tire of seeing it so here it is, once again…and love the remarks TED added about the adBe sure to check out the other nine winners on TED’s Ads Worth Spreading YouTube channel – they’re all great.Tweet
