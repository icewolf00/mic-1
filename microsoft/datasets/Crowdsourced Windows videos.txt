Hot on the heels of the @brandonfoy video for Windows Phone shown during the day 2 keynote at MIX11, comes this video titled Detention – the winner of the Windows video contest in association with MOFILM . Contestants were asked to submit a short video aimed at students with the chance to win over $20,000 in prizes. The Grand Prize was huge: a trip to the Tribeca Film Festival in NYC for 2, a special screening of their film and $8,000 and Josh Soskin, a filmmaker from California picked up the big prize. Congrats!Check out the latest contest which includes a trip to the south of France for one grand prize winner and see the Windows Team Blog for the 4 runner up videos. I’m a fan of this one from Cyril Gfeller in the UK. <!--
