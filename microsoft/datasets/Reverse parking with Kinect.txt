I regularly check on the creative uses of Kinect though there are so many now I haven’t posted about any for a while. One did catch my eye recently though – a reverse parking system using Kinect, developed by Gibson Hu at the University of Technology in Sydney.My own car here in the US has a rear camera that shows up on the 4” LCD whenever I engage reverse so it’s not like I need this solution – though my car doesn’t have parking sensors so maybe I do. Either way, it’s testament to the many ways in which Kinect is being employed. According to the video: The parking assist can switch between color camera mode, infra red camera mode, and reverse parking assist modeWhat I’m really looking forward to though is seeing how companies like Toyota, Telefonica and American Express do with Kinect for Windows.Tweet
