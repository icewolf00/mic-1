Video: Bing and O’Reilly Media: The Future of Search
 Hot on the heels of the much discussed Farsight Beyond the Search Box event, our Bing team has hooked up with O’Reilly to create a series titled “The Future of Search”. Bold words but that’s the ambition Bing has – to move beyond the ten blue links we’ve become accustomed to. What can we expect from this latest collaboration?Every 3-4 weeks, the editors at O’Reilly will be curating discussions around social search, natural language, and “ the web of things” – aiming to look at where we are now and where we may be going. The first topic is Welcome to the party: Social’s potential and limitations on information retrieval and usage  and includes including Esther Dyson, Rich Skrenta of Blekko and Dr. Chris Ahlberg.  The discussion is underway at http://radar.oreilly.com/future-of-search<!--
