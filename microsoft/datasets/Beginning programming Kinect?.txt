The team at Razorfish have been creating amazing stuff for a while with Kinect – now one of them has released a book to help others get the best out of Kinect.James Ashley is a presentation layer architect for Razorfish and has teamed up with Jarrett Webb to release Beginning Kinect Programming with the Microsoft Kinect SDK. I’ve got the book on order and though it’s been about 20 years since I wrote a line of code, I’m prepared to give it a go in the quest to use the Kinect for Windows sensor that is sat in a box next to my desk. Initial review of the book suggest it’s great for beginners though my skills may be a bit rusty so don’t expect anything like the 5D Experience anytime soon.The book is available in paperback now on Amazon and in additional electronic formats from APress, the publisher.Tweet
