I’m not sure how I missed this, but earlier in the week Chris Jones and team posted a preview of Windows Live for Windows 8 and as you’ll see from the video above, they’ve done a lot of work to make the email, calendar and contacts apps really shine with the Metro style of Windows 8. The apps seamlessly connect to our own Live services (like Hotmail, Messenger and Calendar) but also to other services such as GMail, Facebook and Flickr.The blog post notes that this is just the beginning and there is much more to come but this looks like a pretty good start.Tweet
