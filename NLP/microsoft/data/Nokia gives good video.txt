I’ll hand it to the folks at Nokia, they give good video…this latest video from Nokia Research shows us HumanForm, a joint effort between the research team and Nokia Design. While some of the ideas in the video may seem a little far out, the Kinetic device, shown recently at Nokia World show that may not be the the case, with a bendable screen aiding navigation.At least one element of the video reminded me of the recent Office Vision video – around 2 minutes in the Nokia video shows non verbal communications.The whole video just goes to show that there is so much more potential for devices than the current crop we have and Nokia uses another phrase in the video familiar to Microsoft – Natural User Interfaces. It’s the future I tell ya.Tweet
