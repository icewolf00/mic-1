I stumbled across this Mark Lukas
video and realised I’ve seen technology that can make this happen – recently in fact.Andy Wilson from Microsoft Research showed a technology called Lightspace
at the UIST conference last month. The technology combines surface
computing and augmented reality to make any surface and even the space between
surfaces interactive. Andy and Hrvoje Benko show the technology in plenty of
detail in the MSR video. Their video goes way beyond augmented reality books to
be honest, though I do look forward to the day I can take a
book, set it down on my coffee table and have my living room light up with the
contents of the book and a whole set of related content.
