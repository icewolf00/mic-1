Nokia has been doing some epic stuff to highlight the capability of their Windows Phone range – most notably the Lumia 1020. It’s my daily use phone and the camera really is incredible, even more so when put in the right hands, but even amateurs like me can come up with impressive point and click results.The latest project from Nokia is titled Transitions and sees six individuals journey around New Zealand’s South Island – a place of epic beauty. They documented their trips using the Lumia 1020 and the results are pretty breathtaking when you consider they were all shot on a phone.Enjoy.
