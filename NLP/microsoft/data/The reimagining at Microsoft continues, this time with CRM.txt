&amp;amp;#160;You’re hearing that word a lot from Microsoft lately – reimagining – and I’ve posted a LOT of videos here over the last two weeks about what that means, in particular for Windows. The video above highlights the reimagining going on in another part of our business – Microsoft Dynamics CRM – and I’d argue that this is right up there with the best videos from Windows and Surface.This isn’t about making nice videos though, it’s truly about a reimagining of almost every part of Microsoft. In a recent interview with Mashable, Steve Ballmer talked about “the reimagination of Microsoft” and this video is another example of how far and wide that philosophy reaches. You can read more about the new customer experience that is coming with Dynamics CRM on News Center. It’s also an example of another trend that is going on at Microsoft – the integration of cross company assets to bring a better user experience. Windows Phone led the charge in many ways with the integration of Office, Xbox, Bing and now Skype. For Dynamics it means the integration of Yammer and Skype, embedded Bing maps and Microsoft Office 2013 compatibility.It’s a remarkable time to be at Microsoft right now – and to be editing this blog. There is so much going on, so much connectedness…so much energy inside the company. More to come on this soon.
