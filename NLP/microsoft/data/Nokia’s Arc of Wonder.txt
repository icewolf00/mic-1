When Nokia released the Lumia 1020, with its 41 mp sensor and image stabilization, photographers stood up and took notice of its potential to capture some pretty amazing imagery. Among those was Paul Trillo, a New York City-based director and film maker who has since taken a liking to the 1020. Above is the second video that Paul has shot with the 1020 that focuses on life in NYC — the first being ‘Limitless.’  Check them both out. And if you’re really curious, watch the behind the scenes video to see how Paul created this latest work of cinematographic art.
