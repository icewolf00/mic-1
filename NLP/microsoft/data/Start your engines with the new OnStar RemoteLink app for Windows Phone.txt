If your ride is a late model Cadillac, Chevrolet, Buick, or GMC vehicle, you’ll definitely want to grab the new OnStar RemoteLink app for Windows Phone. It’s a key, tire pressure gauge, fuel indicator and more, all in one slickly designed package. Pretty sweet, I must say.Check it out on the Windows Phone Blog, then download the app in the Windows Phone Store (where there’s also an entire app collection devoted to more cool apps that turn your phone into a remote control, by the way).
