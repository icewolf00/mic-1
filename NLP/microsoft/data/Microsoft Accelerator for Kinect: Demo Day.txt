The last few weeks have been a blur for me – with travels to Europe and LA and preparation for Worldwide Partner Conference in Toronto (more on that soon). But I’ve been waiting for today for quite some time. Today is the Microsoft Accelerator for Kinect DEMO day here on our main campus in Redmond. Today, the eleven teams who have been hard at work here in our Seattle office for thirteen weeks, get to show their amazing creations to over 100 investors and VCs.I’ll be there, reporting from the demo floor and talking with the teams as they gear up for their big moment – check back later today for live reports and tomorrow for a full report.Best of luck to all of the teams.Tweet
