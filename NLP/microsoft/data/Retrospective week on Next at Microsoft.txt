If you’ve been following this blog and my associated tweets for any length of time, you’ll know that I love checking out cool technology. I can spend hours noodling with my Window Phone or checking in with colleagues at Microsoft Research to find out what they’re working on.Sometimes I want to stop and pinch myself – because I can’t believe how lucky I am to be able to discover so many fun and amazing things – on campus and online. Even better, I get to share these stories with you. I can connect my experiences through the blog and offer my take on what’s fun and creative at Microsoft.I found while I connect to you about all of these great stories, one that has always been popular with you has been the story of Kinect.Since I started writing this blog in December of last year, I’ve shared about a dozen stories on all of the cool aspects of Kinect. From Kinectimals to the secret sauce behind Kinect and the announcement of the developer kit, we have connected on this amazing story.Which is one of the reasons I thought I would introduce this special week – Retrospective Week – with a video of yours truly telling you what we have in store over the next several days.Welcome to the future of storytelling – via Avatar Kinect.Watch. Enjoy. Tell me what you think.Tweet
