Steve Clayton - Editor - Microsoft News Center Staff

The team at PSFK give me a steady diet of trends, ideas and inspiration from their website, tweets, conferences and now in print. In conjunction with their recent NYC event they released the first issue of the Need To Know Magazine. This release looks at the subject of innovation and how creativity in action builds better businesses. It includes pieces from among others, Jonathan Harris of Cowbird, Rachel Shechtman of STORY, Ryan Jacoby of IDEO, Rob Walker of Significant Objects, futurist and filmmaker Jason Silva, Abe Burmeister of Outlier, Todd Carmichael of La Colombe Torrefaction, and some bloke called Steve Clayton.As you’d expect from the luxe team at PSFK, it’s beautifully well produced and for me, it was a pleasure to disconnect, sit back and read ink on paper for a while.Need To Know is available now from AmazonTweet
