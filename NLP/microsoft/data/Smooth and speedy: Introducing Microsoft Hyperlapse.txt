Professional photographer Nick Didlick always wanted to make a great ski movie, but he had long been stymied by the need for two things: Tons of pricey camera gear, and plenty of time to shoot.Not anymore.A few weeks ago, on a brilliantly sunny early spring day, Didlick headed up to Canada’s Whistler Blackcomb Ski Resort armed with a handful of GoPros, a pair of willing athletes – and a plan for making an action-packed ski movie with the help of a new technology called Microsoft Hyperlapse.By the end of the day, he had most of the footage he needed to create a short, time-lapse movie showing two athletes flying down the mountains of British Columbia, first on skis and then on bikes, before leaping into the water.“I could quite easily make an entertaining ski movie in a day,” Didlick said.Now, everyone else can give that kind of filmmaking a try, too.On Thursday, Microsoft released Microsoft Hyperlapse, a new set of products that create smooth, stabilized time lapses from first-person videos.Read more about Microsoft Hyperlapse, and give it a try.
