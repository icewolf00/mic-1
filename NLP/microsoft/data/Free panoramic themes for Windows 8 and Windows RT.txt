 Seeking to make your Windows 8 dual screen experience more beautiful? A new set of Panoramic themes are now available for free download and compatible with Windows 8 and Windows RT. My personal favorite is the Bridges Panoramic for Windows 8 and Windows RT as shown above. The shot of the Golden Gate Bridge is stunning.Other in the series include  thanks to Rob Margel for the heads up who also notes that these panoramic images will automatically extend across both displays of a dual-monitor setup if both monitors have the same resolution settings. If the displays are different sizes or have different resolution settings, a different image will appear in each monitor. Panoramic themes can be used on single monitor setups, but only the center part of the image will be visible.
