Posts like the one from PJ Jacobowitz earlier this week on the Qualcomm blog delight the inner geek in me. He details what the shift from Snapdragon S1 processors to S2 processors in recent Windows Phone’s really means. Better battery life, faster graphics, quicker cellular downloads and an additional front facing camera for a start. It’s a short post but worth a read if you’re interested in the tech inside your phone.It still amazes me that so much capability can be packed in to something so small.Things are hotting up in the system on a chip arena though and a post yesterday on Technology Review gave a good insight in to Intel’s Medfield chip. It’s the first in their line of Atom chip designs that takes the system on a chip approach.I’m looking forward to seeing what CES brings from both platforms.Tweet
