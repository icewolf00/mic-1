I always had Dassault Systemes down as being involved in aerospace and defense but their portfolio is way wider and last week I spotted a remarkable use they’d found for Kinect for Windows.The Parisian contemporary ballet Mr. & Mrs. Dream includes Kinect sensors placed above the stage to follow the performers movements and create a stunning visual effect. Not only does it make the stage environment portable, it delivers a totally new art form.
