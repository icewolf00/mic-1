I’m a fan of Aviary so it was great to see them launch their Photo Editor SDK for Windows 8 last week. I dig the idea of ‘photo editing as a service’ that they provide. They have awesome photo editing skills allowing other such as Rowi and Memorylage to tap in to that capability and focus on making their app awesome.In addition, Aviary has their own free Photo Editor for Windows 8.
