For nearly 40 years, Microsoft has been working on the frontiers of society where technology, culture and design intersect, in order to help people live more productive lives. Over the past four years, the Next at Microsoft blog has focused much of its attention on these areas of overlap in the company, where exciting, original ideas are being born.

It was pretty cool to hear his initial impressions of the Skype “Universal” Translator from someone who had first-hand experience with the original concept. Now if we can just figure out how to build a transporter…Sit back and enjoy this first in a series of discussions with original thinkers, innovators and tech luminaries.Direct Download – Subscribe via iTunes – Subscribe via RSS – Transcript
