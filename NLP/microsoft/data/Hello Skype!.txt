We just announced that we’ve officially closed the acquisition of Skype which is now a division of Microsoft. Oy vey…Saku beer all round I think. All the news, video and an infographic charting the rise of video calling around the world are on Microsoft’s News Center.in anticipation I’ve been turning my attention to getting friends and family kitted out with a webcam – specifically the Microsoft LifeCam Studio. I love this thing and though it’s not a new video I thought you may enjoy hearing from the team who built it. Friends, don’t be surprised if Santa brings you one of these this year! Tweet
