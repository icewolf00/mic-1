&amp;amp;#160;Microsoft’s Worldwide Partner Conference took place a few weeks ago in Houston and like last year I was asked to help bring some ‘cool stuff’ to the main stage keynotes. This time around it was cool people rather than a ton of demos as invited Lili Cheng, Carl Ledbetter and David Heckerman to the stage to talk about their work at Microsoft. They’re all 17+ year veterans with fascinating careers and their current projects involve social media, Xbox One and the novel application of machine learning respectivelyCheck out the video above to see and hear what these three innovators are working on.
