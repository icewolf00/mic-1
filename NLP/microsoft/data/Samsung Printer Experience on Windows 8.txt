I don’t own a Samsung printer but I’m tempted to go find one to try out this new Samsung Printer Experience app for Windows 8. Who would have thought a humble printer app could look so elegant?Per the details in the Windows Store, the app allows you to manage and control Samsung printers and multi function printers. It includes support for several advanced settings and status notifications, as well as ordering supplies and viewing troubleshooting guides.
