You have probably all seen one of those cool RSA animations of a talk but perhaps not seen one based on a talk by a Microsoft guy. Almost a year ago we profiled Manuel Lima on this blog, senior user experience design lead for Bing, who works out of our New York City office. Ironically I ran in to him a few weeks back while I was visiting the office…he was hard at work designing the next new thing for Bing.Manuel is a a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and was nominated by Creativity magazine as “one of the 50 most creative and influential minds of 2009”. His book, Visual Complexity, launched last year and offers some of his thinking about the visualization of complex networks. This talk explains how we use networks to map and create knowledge.The full lecture is available from the RSA website should you be interested.Tweet
