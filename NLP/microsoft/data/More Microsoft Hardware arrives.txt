The hardware team just keeps cranking stuff out – the Arc Touch Mouse and keyboard are still amongst my all time favorites, along with the LifeCam Studio – this week, they’re joined by the LifeCam HD-3000 and Express Mouse. Both were announced over the the Hardware blog today. The Express Mouse is a wired mouse that has Blue Track tech and doesn’t require batteries. I love the way the product page says it’s built for “effortless comfort when posting and tweeting”. It’ll be available in April for around $20 initially in Flint Grey and Hibiscus Red. It’s joined by the Comfort Mouse 3000 and Comfort Mouse 6000. In the webcam corner the LifeCam HD-3000 – another HD webcam in the stable coming in at around $40. Nice!That’s my quick hardware update for now…<!--
