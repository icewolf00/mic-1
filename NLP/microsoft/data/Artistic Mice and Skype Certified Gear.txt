It’s been a busy week for the Microsoft Hardware team. Earlier in the week  they announced Newly Skype Certified Microsoft Webcams and Headsets and I can offer my personal recommendation on the LifeChat LX-6000 headset. I’ve been using it for a few weeks and the quality of audio is exceptional, plus it’s very comfortable to wear for long periods. If you’re using Skype you can combine that with a killer webcam such as the LifeCam Studio (my weapon of choice). Not only does it have beautiful industrial design, it rocks a a 1080p HD sensor.Not content with that announcements, the team also announced an expansion of the Artist Edition mice. Five new designs across the Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 and Arc Touch Mouse…from five artists across the globe. But there’s more…several limited edition colors for The Explorer Touch Mouse and the Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500. Get all the details over on the Microsoft Hardware blogTweet
