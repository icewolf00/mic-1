With an exciting week coming into the rearview mirror, and a 3-day weekend stretching out ahead here in the US, the timing feels perfect for a return to our time-honored tradition of Forza Fridays.That’s right, the good folks at Xbox are including Forza Motorsport 5 in the slate of games that will be available when Xbox One launches. I for one was blown away by the slick and very cinematic trailer they released, and can’t wait take this bad boy for a spin.
