Nice catch by Todd Bishop who spotted this trailer for a forthcoming Microsoft movie. That’s right…a movie. It’s titled Ctrl+Alt+Compete.Ctrl+Alt+Compete is a documentary that “takes a revealing look at the startup and emerging business scene through the eyes of 5 founders and their teams and tells a story of the passion, fortitude and insanity that is bringing a startup to life”. Daryll McDade explains more in a guest blog on the Bizspark site and names the 5 startups under the spotlight as Aboutone.com, LiquidSpace, POPVOX, Guardly, Supergiant Games. The movie gets its first airing at the inaugural Napa Valley Film Festival this November and will become more broadly available in the months after.In the blot post, Daryll mentions that in addition to more than 100 hours of footage the team captured more than 70 interviews to get the perspective of several seasoned entrepreneurs, investors, industry watchers and tastemakers. Not all of that made it in to the movie so they plane to share it on the Facebook page and YouTube channel. If you’ve been following along with Ctrl+Alt+Compete you’ll know there are already some interview segments with folks like Tim O’Reilly on Channel 9.This should be fun.
