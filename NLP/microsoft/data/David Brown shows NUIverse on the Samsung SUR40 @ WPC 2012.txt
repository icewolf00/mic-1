During the 30 minute NEXT demos I hosted last week at Worldwide Partner Conference, this was a real crowd pleaser so I thought it was worth sharing stand-alone.David Brown is from the Microsoft Technology Centre in the UK and is the developer of this application – NUIVerse. In this video, David demonstrates the capabilities of the Samsung SUR40 with Microsoft PixelSense – highlighting the multi user, multi-touch features and the ability for PixelSense to “see” physical objects.If you’ve not seen this before, you’re in for a real treat.Tweet
