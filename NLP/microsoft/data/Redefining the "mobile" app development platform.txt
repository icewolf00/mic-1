In the last couple years studies have shown that nearly half of Gen-Yers prefer having a smartphone over a car. Ford’s response has been to more tightly integrate the car and the phone so drivers can personalize their experience. A couple weeks ago PSFK posted video of a talk by Julius Marchwicki, who leads the car maker’s efforts – namely, SYNC AppLink.What AppLink does is it lets drivers interact with the apps on their smartphone using the voice recognition capabilities of Windows Embedded Automotive. And Ford’s goal is that developers around the world will create versions of their apps that support AppLink, giving drivers more to choose from.  (If you read my 2013 CES trip report then you may recall Ford’s launch of a development program for AppLink.) On a related note, last weekend’s episode of Geekwire featured a a conversation between Todd Bishop and Jay Loney, who I profiled a few weeks ago for his work on Windows Embedded Automotive. It’s a great discussion of Microsoft’s vision for where in-car technology is headed.
