 I posted this a while back on my personal blog and figured it was worth sharing here as some fun for a Friday. I thought I’d found most of the tricks Windows Phone 7 has up it’s sleeve but no, this puppy has way more tricks up it’s sleeve. It’s one thing I love about the marketing…we’ve not had every feature explained to us in excruciating detail. The team behind it seem to know the delight and childlike glee of finding something you didn’t know was there…it reminds me of the days of Easter eggs and is in part what I was trying to explain in yesterday’s post on the personality of Windows Phone 7. Head to pocket-lint.com for 72 tips and tricks…here are 3 of my favorites.  <!--
