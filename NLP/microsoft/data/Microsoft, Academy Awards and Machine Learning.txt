Following on from yesterday’s post about the future of programming, I thought it’d be worth a look back on a post titled Machine learning for dummies. It’s proven to be one of the most popular posts on Next since we launched and one of the better titled posts I’ve made – there are a surprising number of searches for Machine learning for dummies and whether it’s Google or Bing, all roads for that query lead here!Oh and that chap up above…that’s John Platt. He taught me a lot about machine learning. He’s a researcher in Microsoft Research and the reason he’s holding Oscar from Sesame Street? Find out in the Machine learning for dummies post. Trust me, it’s a very good reason.Tweet
