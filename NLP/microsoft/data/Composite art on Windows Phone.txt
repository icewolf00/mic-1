I’ve been busy installing app on to my new Windows Phone this week and Angry Birds Star Wars definitely makes the list. I have a few other eclectic apps I love though which don’t have the profile of the Rovio smash hit.One such app is Composite from James Alliban. I’ve written about some of James’s great work with Kinect here on NEXT and he’s also brought his creative skills to Windows Phone. Composite enables you to “remix” your surroundings to create artistic compositions by painting pictures using the live video stream from the front and back facing cameras.It’s fun and easy to use and results in some distinctive art. Grab it from the Windows Phone store today.
