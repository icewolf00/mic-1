 [click for full size version]It’s a slow few weeks in the tech world and a few weeks away from the PC for me so expect things to be less busy here in NEXT until the end of August. I will be keeping up with the Photograph’s around Microsoft though as well as posting about some interesting Microsoft Research projects so don’t switch off completely!This week’s photo is from our Visitor Center here in Redmond, WA and features the legendary Atari 2600 (I believe this is the 1977 “Heavy Sixer” edition).Be sure to check out the interactive tour of Microsoft’s Visitor Center including a Photosynth I shot last year.
