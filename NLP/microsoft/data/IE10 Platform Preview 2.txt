I’ll keep it brief as this has been covered in many other places – IE10 Platform Preview 2, (as seen in the recent public “Windows 8” demos) is now available for download.In the video above, Ari Bixhorn introduces 3 new demos shipping as part of this platform preview including a Bellagio demo of web workers, drag and drop fridge magnets, and a new riff on the fishtank called Fireflies. With graphics and sound offloaded to the GPU, you get impressive results – especially when compared to other browsers.For more info and to check out the demo and grab the bits, head to ietestdrive.comTweet
