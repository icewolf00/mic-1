There’s a great video about the Mawingu White Space Broadband Project, which is just one piece of the Microsoft 4Afrika Initiative we announced yesterday. The amazing thing about this project is that it uses whitespace in the UHF bands to broadcast a wireless signal from television antennas for distances up to five miles, creating this enormous wireless network in rural Kenya. And it’s all powered by the sun.One of the guys in charge of the project, Paul Garnett, goes into further detail on the Official Microsoft blog, and you can read more about 4Afrika on the Microsoft News Center.
