Mobile World Congress is here and if you’re attending with a Windows Phone 8 device, you can grab an NFC version of your conference badge thanks to the NFC Badge app.NFC Badge is the official application for entry to Mobile World Congress and enables delegates to pass through perimeter access points at the event using a supported NFC handset (hello Nokia 920 and HTC 8x).Now, when will British Airways allow me to do that with my boarding pass? Its sounds like Japan Airways is leading the way there.
