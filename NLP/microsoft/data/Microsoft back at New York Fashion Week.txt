Last year I was at New York Fashion Week exploring the intersection of fashion and technology and this year, Microsoft was back in force at the event. We hosted the Modellounge X Microsoft at Union Square, offering a refuge for models with a lot of cool tech such as Xbox, Nokia Lumia 1020’s and Surface.We also went behind the scenes to see how technology inspired Cesar Galindo’s spring 2014 collection preview.
