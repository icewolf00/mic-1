I like the style of these ads – building on the Andrew Belle video from late last year, this ad shows choreographer Bobby Bonsey and producer Egan Orion working with a bunch of products to bring a flash mob together in Seattle. Cool to see some places I know in the video but more than that, I like the way they’re shot, the mix of products used and the connection between the products. The fonts use for titles – those little details count too and cool to see how the weave The Killers in there and even a hashtag!I’d love to see this run as a TV spot…hat tip to @winrumors and Brad Tipp<!--
