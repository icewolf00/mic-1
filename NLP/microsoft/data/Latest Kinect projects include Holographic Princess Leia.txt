  I recently spotted two projects using Kinect that I thought NEXT readers would enjoy. The first project is from Dr. Dave Brown who joined me on stage at last years Worldwide Partner Conference to demo NUIverse on the Samsung SUR40.  Now he’s built a framework for rendering holographic videos recorded from a Kinect – as shown above with the canonical Leia video. The second is from Second Story in Portland, with a project called Lose Your Occlusion that uses two Kinect sensors to create full 3-D models. Using one Kinect sensor can result in occluded parts of a scene. But with two, Second Story combined the source data to a single mesh with impressive effects.Never a dull day when Kinect is around.
