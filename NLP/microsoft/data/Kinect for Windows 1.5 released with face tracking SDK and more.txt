Today they released version 1.5 of the Kinect for Windows runtime and SDK.Kinect for Windows hardware is now available in Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan and beginning next month it will arrive in 15 additional countries: Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Finland, India, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates. The 1.5 SDK also brings a number of new capabilities, all of which are detailed on the Kinect for Windows blog.
