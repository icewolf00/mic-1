I’m digging the fact that tweets that include images hosted on SkyDrive now show up inline per the image/tweet above. If you grab the URL of an image from SkyDrive (or post from your Windows Phone) the tweet shows up with a view photo option on Twitter.com – clicking that button shows the image inline.  nice catch WMPU
