Pretty cool story yesterday on the Microsoft News Center about Autolib, a company in Paris that uses Windows Embedded to  provide customers with a more personalized car-sharing service. Each of its 60,000 customers has a card that contains data about things like their favorite radio stations and what temperature they want the climate control set at. Before getting in, the customer scans their card and the car makes the necessary adjustments.
