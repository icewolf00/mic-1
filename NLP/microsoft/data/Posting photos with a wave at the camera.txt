Summer’s not quite over yet, and families who are squeezing in one last vacation at the Great Wolf Lodge water park in Grand Mound, Wash., have a fun new option for automatically sharing their photos via Facebook. The resort chain already uses guests’ RFID-enabled wristbands as room keys and in-house charge accounts; now guests at this location can also sign up at a dedicated kiosk to link the wristbands to their Facebook accounts. Then, at five camera-equipped posts in the park, they can simply wave the wristband and automatically upload a photo to their Facebook wall.This seems like a natural extension of the NUI concept — what could be more natural than waving at the camera? It’s one more way to bring the online and offline worlds together seamlessly.Tweet
