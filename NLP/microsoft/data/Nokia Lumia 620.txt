That’s a pretty good looking phone Nokia just announced – the Lumia 620. The glossy looking finish is due to a new ‘dual-shot’ technique that casts two layers of polycarbonate – a single base layer and a second color, in a transparent or translucent layer. Added to that the 620 has exchangeable shells that allow you to change the color as often as you like. I love it – reminds me of the frenzy with early Nokia’s around snap on cases. Bring it back I say!The Nokia Conversations post has a great blog about the 620 and while this is the most affordable of the Lumia range, they haven’t skimped on specs with a 3.8-inch display, 5-megapixel camera and a front-facing VGA camera, dual-core 1Ghz processor, 8GB of internal storage and a microSD slot. Pretty amazing for $249.
