The Interaction Design team at Microsoft just released a film short about how the maker movement is opening new possibilities for the user, while bringing greater responsibilities to the designer.In Connecting: Makers, designers and teachers from some of the greatest design schools and studios discuss the potential of breakthroughs like 3D printing and the Internet of things, as well as some of the tough questions that must be answered about the cultural impact of technology.Much like its predecessor from two years ago, Connecting: Makers gives you a great listening post to hear the thoughts and concerns of some of the world’s greatest interactive designers.Check out both videos on the Connecting website.
