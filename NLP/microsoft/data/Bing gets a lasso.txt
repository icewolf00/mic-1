One stood out for me – lasso. This feature enables you to search for items without having to use copy and paste or to type a search phrase in to the query box. You simply circle a term and Bing does the rest. Simple and efficient – reducing something that currently takes up to nine steps on an iPad down to one step. A more natural way to do things you could say.Check out the video for more details from the ever effervescent Stefan Weitz and grab the app later today in the app store. Tweet
