 [updated with full video] 22:38-38:40 for the MSR projectIf you’re a regular reader, you’ll be familiar with the wearable multitouch projector from Microsoft Research. Andy Wilson of MSR took it to NYC last yesterday for On The Verge. The short clip above shows Josh in typically jocular forum with Andy projecting on his back. I’m looking forward to seeing the full show tomorrow.Share
