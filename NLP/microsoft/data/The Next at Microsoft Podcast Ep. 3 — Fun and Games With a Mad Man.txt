The third episode of our podcast series is up, featuring a conversation with actor Rich Sommer. You may know him better as Harry Crane, the Hollywood-focused perennial misfit from AMC’s “Mad Men.” What you may not know is that he’s also an avid gamer, in both computer and board games — he has a collection of more than 800 of the latter. Rich and I talk about how he’s benefited from technology in both his career and his gaming experience. He also gives us the complete breakdown of what’s going to happen in the final season of “Mad Men.”No, not really. That was an April Fool’s joke. Rich is too much of a professional to divulge any spoilers, but he does share insights into his work on the show and in other TV, film and voice-over roles — like how he uses Skype to work from anywhere. We also spend some time talking about the evolution of both online and board gaming, including how technology helps to make board gaming dynamic and responsive in a way we’re more accustomed to seeing in online gameplay.Direct Download – Subscribe via iTunes – Subscribe via RSSEnjoy some insights into the best games to look for and how to dress for recording audio in a home studio.
