We’ve all had that moment in email – when you hit send and realize the attachment you meant to add wasn’t actually attached. No more, thanks to the work of Bhavesh Chauhan, a Microsoft engineer, and The Garage.I’ve mentioned The Garage a few times here on NEXT – a grass roots community of creators at Microsoft as well as a physical space in building 4 on our main campus. This month, it has caught the eye of Fast Company thanks to the work of Bhavesh – his creation is now part of Outlook 2013.In related news, don’t forgot to check out one of our most popular posts on this blog – another Garage project known as Mouse Without Borders.
