 Alex Kipman is no stranger to awards – in fact last time I wrote about our GM of Xbox it was to acknowledge him receiving Microsoft’s highest technical honor, the Technical Recognition Award for Outstanding Technical Leadership.He’ll need to make room on his office shelf for the latest award from The Intellectual Property Owners Education Foundation. They just awarded their National Inventor of the Year Award to Alex. The Award recognizes “Outstanding Achievement in the Fields of Innovation, Creativity, and IP Rights” and fosters the spirit of American innovation and highlights the protection offered to inventors by the patent system. At a ceremony at the Smithsonian American Art Museum and National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., Kipman was recognized for the invention of Kinect.Bart Eppenauer, Chief Patent Counsel at Microsoft, has a great interview over on the Microsoft on the Issues blog today.Congrats to Alex!
