As an member of the Design Museum in London I tend to keep tabs on what’s going on at the Shad Thames enclave of all things design. This week saw the Design of the Year 2012 award announced and the Olympic Torch won top honors. In the digital category our very own Kinect and Kinect SDK won and in graphics our friends at Nokia won for their Nokia Pure Font.Next week I’m off to check out the Kinect Accelerator program to find out what is being built with the Kinect for Windows SDK and will report back on my findings. In the meantime, congrats to the Kinect and Kinect SDK teams on another award to add to their growing list. It seems like a good opportunity to take another look at he Kinect Effect video.Tweet
