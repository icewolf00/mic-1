I spent last Thursday at the PSFK event in San Francisco and I’ll be honest, I needed it. I’d forgotten how good it can be to take a day away from the office, kick back and listen to people smarter than myself talk about a wide variety of interesting topics. Many of them were not germane to the work I do at Microsoft, or the themes of this blog, but sometimes it’s just good to step outside of the day to day and get an injection of creativity. The lineup was perfect for that.Yves Béhar of fuseproject paid his respects to Steve Jobs and talked about Apple’s role in legitimizing design. He also talked about typography asked attendees to imagine what a world of Microsoft typography would be like – I think he meant that negatively but aside from Comic Sans (of course), I think we’ve had a solid contribution there. He reminded me of my pal Hugh MacLeod as he talked about products being the brand and the declining role of marketing and advertising to shape our perceptions. I have to say, I totally agree and his closing sentiment that design isn’t a short term assignment was right on a brand needs to be curated over a long period of time. My addition to that though it that changing a brand perception needs the same tenacity.I’ll dig deeper into some of the sessions over the coming weeks and as the videos become available will post those but a few other takeaways to share: In summary, Piers and team at PSFK throw a fine event and gather a brilliant mix of thought-provoking speakers. The panel session didn’t quite work for me but in terms of spending a day of my time getting a brain recharge, it was terrific.More to follow as I dig in to the sessions in more detail.Tweet
