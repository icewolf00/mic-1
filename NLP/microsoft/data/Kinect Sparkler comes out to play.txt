Kinect Sparkler arrived in Fun Labs today so I decided to give it a shot – this is my first take on some 3D Kinect art with a cameo from my Twitter avatar in the background. It’s a good example of the finger tracking capability of Kinect and the 3D photo is pretty funky too! The only thing missing is the ability to embed the video direct from KinectShare.comTweet
