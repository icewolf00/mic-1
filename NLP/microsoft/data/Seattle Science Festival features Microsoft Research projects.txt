[update] if you didn’t get to attend in person, here’s what you missed courtesy of Seattle’s KOMO News.Seattle is hosting the area’s first Science Festival this month – all part of the celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1962 Seattle World’s Fair. The region’s schools, universities, cultural institutions, research centers and businesses are gathering to celebrate the importance of science and technology and of course, Microsoft will be there.Regular readers of this blog will be familiar with the work of Microsoft Research who are hosting a booth at Science Expo Day tomorrow that is chock full of some of the latest and greatest prototypes from our labs.WorldWide Telescope will be there on a huge Jumbotron screen along with an array of Kinect related demos such as Beamatron, Holoflector and Illumishare. Kodu and Cliplets are two other projects in the booth – both projects you can walk away from the Expo and play with at home. Kodu is software that enables you to design video games without having to know any programming before you start. And Cliplets is a free download that makes creation of your own micro movies the work of a moment. Beyond the Microsoft booth there are plenty of other things to exploreand fine food of course because this is Seattle… So if you’re in the Seattle area tomorrow be sure to stop by Science Expo Day at the Seattle Center– open from 10-6 and free to everyone!Tweet
