Following the recent Microsoft Campus “underground tour” I hosted with Josh Topolosky and Chad Mumm, the team at The Verge posted a second blog post of an interview Josh conducted with Steve Kaneko, design director in our Office group. The short clip above sees Steve talking about the confidence in design that exists at Microsoft today.It’s a pretty interesting interview that I sat and watched being recorded in person and it’s sparked some great commentary within the blog post. This one stood out for meRegardless of brand allegiance, preference, or whatever, all this effort that Microsoft is putting into its products is making me really excited about what’s next. They are really starting to feel like a whole different company.There is a healthy debate with many good observations in there. Worth a read of the comments but before you do that, check out the full 27 minute interviewTweet
