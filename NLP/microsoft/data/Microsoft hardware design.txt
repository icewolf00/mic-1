This final video from our What’s Next booth at CES is actually a little more what’s now as it highlights some of the Microsoft hardware that is available today. We  wanted to celebrate the design culture at Microsoft and some of their work that goes unseen by using images that show the beauty inside their designs. There has been a lot of talk about Metro style design this week – this video shows our designers and industrial engineers care just as much about hardware as they do software.But don’t take my word for it – the Arc Touch Mouse received another accolade this week. It’s been accepted into the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, part of the Smithsonian. In addition our hardware team announced two new colors for the mouse – Sangria Red Diamond and Cement Gray.  Follow the Microsoft hardware blog to keep up with more from the team. Tweet
