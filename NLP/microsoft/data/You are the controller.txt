Yesterday I talked about how sports are becoming more and more digital through our apparel – they’re also becoming more life life on Xbox thanks to Kinect. I downloaded the Kinect Sports: Season Two Demo last night and tried golf and tennis. While the tennis isn’t really my thing, the golf was a lot of fun – controlling club selection with your voice for example. My putting needs as much work as it does in the real world though. I remember playing Wii Sports when it first came out and having a lot of fun with my family but this really does move things on. As the adverts say, you are the controller, and the reality of that is it will lower the barrier for adoption for young and old. My parents are quite intimidated by an Xbox controller or even the Wii wand but with Kinect, they’re more inclined to get up and get involved. It bodes well for more people to enjoy the benefits and fun of technology.Six new sports are on their way…and you can add the free demo to your Xbox LIVE download queue now.Tweet
