Microsoft released an iPhone app on Wednesday that puts the skill of a professional photographer in your pocket.Microsoft Pix captures a burst of 10 frames with each shutter click – some from before the tap – and uses artificial intelligence to select up to three of the best and unique shots. Before the remaining frames are deleted, the app uses data from the entire burst to remove noise, and then intelligently brightens faces, beautifies skin and adjusts the color and tone.While the app is selecting and enhancing the best of the burst, another set of algorithms sorts through the frames to determine whether any motion such as a person’s hair tussled by the wind or the cascade of a waterfall in the background can be looped for a Harry Potter-esque effect called Live Image.To learn more about the artificial intelligence Microsoft Pix puts in the iPhone camera, read the full story.
