I spent some time in Building 4 on Microsoft’s main campus last week – this shot is taken from the 2nd floor staircase, overlooking a giant piece of art off to the right and the living wall that sits alongside the stairs.The building underwent a full scale renovation a little over a year ago which was covered in a video by my friends from Channel 9. It remains one of the coolest buildings on our campus and is home to The Garage and some of the Office team.
