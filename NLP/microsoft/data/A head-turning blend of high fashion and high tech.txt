File this one under the heading of “unique takes on wearable technology.” A designer in Montreal fashioned two haute couture dresses that light up whenever its dark. What’s even more amazing is that the threads of the dresses actually move in response to peoples’ glances.Certainly more subtle than the Printing Dress or Ms. Underwood’s Grammy Gown, but give the designer extra points for finesse.(Hat tip to Design Milk.)
