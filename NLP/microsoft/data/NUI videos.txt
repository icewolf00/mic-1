I’ve been talking a lot about NUI at CES this week and recently stumbled across a NUI Group on Vimeo.They have some great Surface videos from Razorfish and with Surface 2.0 announced this week I’m looking forward to more videos being added as I think the new LCD form factor of the Samsung SUR40 will spur a whole new set of uses for the device. I’m planning a longer post on NUI during my flight back this evening as I want to go a little further explaining that it’s more than just sensory inputs like touch, gesture and speech. We’re just at the beginning of the NUI revolution where technology will increasingly become invisible. <!--
