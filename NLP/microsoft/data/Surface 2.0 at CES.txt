The next in our series of videos exploring the What’s Next space in the Microsoft booth at CES focuses on Surface 2.0.We first showed Surface 2.0 at CES last year and it’s been a real hit in the booth this year as it’s been available for people to come and play with and see it first hand. There is much more than first meets the eye with this device as it uses a vision based system to go beyond what’s possible today with touch screens that you may see in smartphones or slate devices. Check out the video as Rob Wolf and I take a tour through some of the tech and applications.Tweet
