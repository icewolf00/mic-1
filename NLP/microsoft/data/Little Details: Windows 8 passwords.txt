It’s been a while since our last Little Details post. This one comes from Windows 8 and concerns the password entry field you likely encounter several times a day on the web. You know, the username/password combo boxes with the latter obfuscated by stars or periods usually – similar to above.The difference in Windows 8, whether in dialog boxes in the operating system, or on the web you get the small “peek” icon when you start typing in the password field. Clicking our touching the icon briefly reveals what you’ve typed – as shown below. Neat…a like it.thanks to Richard Banks for suggesting this one. [note this feature can be disabled by Group Policy in Windows 8 Pro and Enterprise]
