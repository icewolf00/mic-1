Yep, you can investigate the Autovista motors in Forza Motorsport 4 using Kinect. Slightly odd, but very cool.After almost a week of driving Forza 4, I really donâ€™t have much to addÂ beyond my post on TuesdayÂ â€“ itâ€™s still epic and Iâ€™m still blown away by the graphics and game play, especially rivals mode.In fact I love this game so much, that Iâ€™m going to give my copy of the game away. To have a chance of winning, first, follow me on @stevecla and send a tweetÂ with #forzadraw. Iâ€™ll pick a winner next week and explain why Iâ€™m giving my copy away ðŸ™‚Â In the meantime,Â I thought Iâ€™d just leave you with a few more photos I took of my experiences and a link to download the Forza Motorsport 4 desktop theme for Windows 7.Tweet
