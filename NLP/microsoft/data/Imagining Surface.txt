 Brian Hall just posted about this new Surface video over on the Surface blog.I’m publishing this post from my Surface Pro and though the ad is focused on Surface RT, it makes the point that Surface, regardless of RT or Pro, is incredibly versatile. That’s what I love about it – one minute I am consuming using NextGen Reader, the next minute I’m creating using Live Writer. And when I want to do my tax return and need to scan in a whole stack of documents, I can – because of the USB port.Imagine you only needed to carry one device. Yes, I can imagine.
