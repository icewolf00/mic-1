When Microsoft Research started work on the Printing Dress a couple years ago, their goal was to explore the world of wearable computing. So it was a bit of a surprise to see Carrie Underwood grace the stage at the Grammy Awards on Sunday in what appeared to be a very classic gown, only to have it morph into this sort of multi-colored projection screen. For those of you less inclined to watch the Grammy’s, check out Bing’s image search.  And there are some pretty cool GIFs of the dress in action on Mashable. We’d like to think that Miss Underwood’s dress designers took their cue from our own bespoke design. Either way, this affirms our belief in the fusion of  fashion and technology.
