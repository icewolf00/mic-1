Next week, the tech world shifts its focus to Barcelona and the acronym shifts from CES to MWC – aka Mobile World Congress. Microsoft will be there and evidently have a few things to say. To help people stay in touch, Skype will be providing everyone in Spain 2 hours of free access with Skype Wi-Fi at more than 24,000 supported wireless hotspots available in the country.To play along, you simply have to make sure you have the latest version of Skype installed on your Windows or Mac device, or the Skype Wi-Fi app on your iOS device. Just connect to the ‘Skype Wi-Fi’ hotspot on your device’s Wi-Fi settings, and follow the instructions.Find out more at http://www.skype.com/intl/en/features/allfeatures/skype-wifiTweet
