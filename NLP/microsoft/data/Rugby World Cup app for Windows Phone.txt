Just a quick heads up that if you’re following the Rugby World Cup, you can now do that on your Windows Phone. The app, sponsored by Land Rover, is really quite nicely done and makes good use of the Metro style. You get news, fixtures, results, team and player stats and match day highlights via videos.You can download RWC 2011 from the Marketplace for free.Tweet
