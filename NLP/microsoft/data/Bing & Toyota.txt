Another CES announcement that passed me by was the collaboration between Bing and Toyota with the launch of Toyota Entune. Arriving on select models later this year, Bing for Mobile will be a featured app of Entune alongside Pandora, OpenTable and others.Naturally, the Bing app will be driven by voice activation and offer over 16 million points of interest. More on the Bing Community blog including a few screenshots. <!--
