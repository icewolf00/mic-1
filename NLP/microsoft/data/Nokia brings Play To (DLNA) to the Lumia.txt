That little sticker on your TV or laptop that says DLNA – now you have something to use it with if you’re a Nokia Lumia owner. NokiaBetaLabs has just released Play To, enabling Nokia Lumia phones to show pictures and videos wirelessly on other DLNA capable devices (TV’s, BluRay players, Windows Media Player etc.) that are connected to your network.That app is in beta at the moment and requires sign up – which takes all of sixty seconds.Go Play.
