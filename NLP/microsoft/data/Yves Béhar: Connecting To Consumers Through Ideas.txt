I’m a fan of PSFK – their website covers a lot of areas I’m personally interested in and that overlaps nicely with many of the themes here on Next at Microsoft. Technology, creativity and design are key themes of their site and their events.  At the recent San Francisco get together, Piers and the team curated a great day of talks from across these disciplines. One of my favorites was Yves Béhar of fuseproject who talked about 360 degree design.Tweet
