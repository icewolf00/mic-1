I presented at a Windows Embedded conference recently (videos coming soon) and mentioned that if I was back at college now, I’d be taking classes in data visualization. Check the video above to see the career I’d be chasing…people who can do this stuff are going to be in BIG demand over the coming years. Nick Felton is the poster child, and now works at Facebook designing stuff like timeline.Don’t take my word for it though, Fortune posted a piece on Data Scientists last month and noted that 300 people attended the first-ever data scientist summit in Las Vegas in last May.  Tweet
