My friends at Vectorform are usually found showing the capabilities of Microsoft Surface with amazing apps like Settlers of Catan and most recently Pandemic 1.0 which was shown at the Sundance Film Festival and covered by Gizmodo and Softpedia – it’s a transmedia project including film, phones, actors, Twitter and Surface with a the town as the set.Not resting on their Surface laurels, the Vectorform team also released Kayak for Windows Phone 7 and Vectorform DJ. The former is a client for flight and hotel search, the latter a casual music composer app. <!--
