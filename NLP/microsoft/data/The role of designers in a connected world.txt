&amp;amp;amp;#160;Albert Shum is one of my favorite people to chat with at Microsoft – always engaging, always has a smile and insightful about the role of technology in our lives. In this recent talk at the IxDA conference, Interaction13, Albert shares his thoughts about the world of technology and how designers need to think about interaction and experience design in this world.It’s well worth a watch of the Connecting video too that Albert and his team worked on.
