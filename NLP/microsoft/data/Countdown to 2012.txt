So here we are, 1 day away from a new year – another year of tech progress and surprises. So what am I looking forward to in 2012? Here’s my shortlist Okay, I’ll pause there and say that those are the 4 Microsoft products that excite me the most – not least because of the emergence of a common design aesthetic across them with metro. You can hear more about that in a great interview The Verge did with Steve Kaneko. So what am I looking forward to beyond our own products?  Lists like this are supposed to have ten things but 7 has always been my lucky number so I’ll leave it there. Expect to see much more on all of these here on Next at Microsoft during 2012.Thanks for your readership during our first year, and if there are things you’d like to see more (or less) of feel free to leave them in the comments or send me email.Tweet
