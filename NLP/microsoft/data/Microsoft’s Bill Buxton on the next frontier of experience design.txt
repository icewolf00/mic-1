I’m a big fan of Bill Buxton – he’s a pioneer in the field of user experience design and we’re lucky to have him at Microsoft Research. I’m also a big fan of WIRED so naturally enjoyed seeing Cliff Kuang’s recent article on “Why a New Golden Age for UI Design is Around the Corner” given he talked at length with Bill who suggests that as more and more connected devices pile up around us, we should “stop focusing on the individual objects as islands” and start designing for an ecosystem that works better together.Microsoft’s design ethos embodies this approach as I discussed in the recent story at microsoft.com /stories/design/
