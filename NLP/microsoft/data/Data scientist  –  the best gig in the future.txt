I’ve been telling anyone who will listen lately (admittedly a small group) that the job of the future is Data Scientist – I even implored a recent conference in London to go out and hire these people. This EMC infographic does a nice job of explaining why the explosion in data, driven by social media, the Internet of Things etc. is driving this need. Interesting that today’s business intelligence professionals aren’t considered high on the list as future data scientists.On and a complementary post from Steve Lohr in the New York Times yesterday titled The Age of Big Data.source: EMC via MashableTweet
