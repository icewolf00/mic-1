It’s early July so that means conference season here at Microsoft. Later today I head to Toronto for the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference that runs from July 8th – 12th. Like last year, I’ll be helping to host portions of the keynotes with Jon Roskill – I have a few surprises up my sleeve so if you’re attending or watching via Digital WPC, Tuesday morning should be fun.I’ll also be hosting a morning show from 08:30 – 09:00 each day (EDT) and while I don’t think it’s going to challenge Good Morning America I can guarantee we’ll have some interesting characters and topics to warm the Air Canada Center up before the show goes live each day. In fact, the show is live throughout the day time thanks to MPN Live with shows at 11:00-11:30 am and 5:00 pm.We’ll be streaming on Digital WPC home page, and also on the but also on our WPC Faceboook page. You can follow on Twitter with the hashtag #MPNLive and I’ll be monitoring the stream through the broadcast so feel free to chat live. Watch out for the FourSquare location I’ll be checking in to as well and if you can steal the mayorship from me, big prizes await!Next up…what I’m packing for Toronto.Tweet
