Windows 8.1 is installed on all my machines now – six of them I think. It’s a thing of beauty – as is this new ad for the OS that celebrates the variety of PCs that run Windows 8.1 as well as some of the applications, notably 3D printing support which comes built it in. It’s one of my favorite ads of late. Enjoy!
