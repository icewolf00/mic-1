For the last few weeks the Windows Phone blog has published a series on some of the best apps for Windows Phone 8. One of my favorite posts was about the best apps for skiers and boarders, all of which are more about giving you up-to-the-minute snow conditions and trail maps. I’m still waiting for an app that can help me get down the mountain with a bit more style as I’m nursing a very sore back after an epic wipeout on Alpental mountain recently. There’s also a great post on apps that can help you take better photos and makes them easier to share – Lomogram is my new favorite from that bunch. One photo app you won’t find in the roundup is BLINK, which was developed by Microsoft Research and released to the public yesterday. Definitely worth checking out.…and don’t miss a new feature on Microsoft’s News Center – App of the Week
