WIRED.com featured a great article last week on the Internet of things and it’s well worth a read if you haven’t done so already. Bill Wasik gave a thorough explanation of how we’ve reached the point where many of our devices have the capability of being connected, and it’s opened the door to a plethora of new opportunities. Do yourself a favor and set aside half an hour to read about what’s in store … and what’s already happening.Photo Credits: Michael Wolf, Wired.com
