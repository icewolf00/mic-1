No, we don’t have a magic circle team here at Microsoft – well, we probably do but I’ve yet to find them. What we do have is the team who built Kinect and last night they were recognized at The Churchill Club’s inaugural awards dinner. The club is Silicon Valley’s premier business and technology forum that has run for over 25 years.Microsoft won the Magical Team award for Kinect for Xbox 360 – recognizing “collaborative breakthroughs resulting in an irresistible product”. We were in good company with other award winners, including Facebook, Khan Academy and Elon Musk/Tesla.Nominations were submitted by the Churchill Club Academy – a group of 350 distinguished business and technology executives and professionals, investors, entrepreneurs, academics, and members of the press. The Academy voted on the entire list of nominations submitted and an internal selection committee reviewed the votes and finalized the top nominees.Each award has a Spirit of the award subtitle and for the category in which Kinect won, that subtitle is “You guys nailed it”I couldn’t agree more!Tweet
