Following on from my recent video interviews with Kevin Dallas and Jim Buczkowski at IDC’s SMART TECHnology World, this third video is a discussion I had with Ton Steenman from Intel. They have a huge business in intelligent systems, much of which is accompanied by a Windows operating system.We also talked about a quote Ton gave during his talk that by 2020 we’ll be generating 35 trillion gigabytes of data and he helped me understand the infrastructure implications that will bring.The final video in this series will be up early next week – a discussion with Mario Morales from IDC.Tweet
