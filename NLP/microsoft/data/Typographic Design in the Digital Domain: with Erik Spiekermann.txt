I’m a big fan of Metro. It’s the design language you see in Windows Phone and I recently linked to a presentation at BUILD where Sam Moreau talked about the principles and personality of Metro style in Windows 8. In Sam’s talk, he references the importance of typography in Metro – if you have any interest in this topic, I think you’ll also enjoy this short film featuring the godfather of modern type, Erik Spiekermann. Here he talks with Elliot Jay Stocks about how typography is used in the digital domain and what digital designers can learn from traditional print techniques.Props to Andrew Spooner our UK developer evangelism team for this video.
