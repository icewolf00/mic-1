Nokia has a reputation for design that’s bold and cutting-edge, with a touch of whimsy. The novelty of the Nokia 5110’s removable faceplates is one example, a feature that was reintroduced with the Lumia 820.  Well Nokia is taking that idea a step further with the 3D Printing Challenge and it’s generated a fair amount of interest since being announced last week. Pictured above is Makerbot’s own contribution to the competition. Those of you with a 3-D printers can now design and create your own Lumia 820 cases and submit them to Nokia for consideration. The winning designer even has a chance to fly to Barecelona in February for Mobile World Congress. I think it’s time to get out my sketch pad.
