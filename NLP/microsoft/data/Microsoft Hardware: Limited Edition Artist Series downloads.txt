I’m a big fan of of the Artist Series of of mice from the Microsoft Hardware team. My main tool of choice continues to be the Deanne Cheuk edition of the Microsoft Touch Mouse – it works wonderfully with the Windows 8 Consumer Preview.The hardware team has a microsite dedicated to the Artist Series that takes a look at the artists behind the hardware and includes a set of associated wallpaper downloads amongst other things.Tweet
