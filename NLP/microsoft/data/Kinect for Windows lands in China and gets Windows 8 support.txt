Along with updates to the Kinect for Windows runtime and software development kit, Craig Eisler just announced that the Kinect for Windows sensor is now available in China. I expect a new wave of amazing creations from the Chinese development community and commercial organizations seeking to build on Kinect.The SDK updates? They include more sensor data, extended range of use and control over camera settings from within the SDK. That’s just the start and Craig’s blog has more details but one that has me really intrigued is that skeletal tracking is now supported on multiple sensors within a single application. That should make for some pretty interesting real-time 3D capture.Oh and one other small feature that people have been waiting on. Windows 8 support…and virtual machine support Have at it.
