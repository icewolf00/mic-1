I’m a big fan of Burton and of course the Nokia Lumia 800 so this stunt by the two companies hit all the right notes for me.During the Burton Snowboard’s European Open event in Laax, Switzerland, Nokia set up a trampoline surrounded by 18 Nokia Lumia 800s for 180° coverage of the area. Professional snowboarders and attendees were invited to showcase their snowboard tricks on the 180° Freeze Trampoline and then presented with a bullet time video of their tricks after the event. Nice!Tweet
