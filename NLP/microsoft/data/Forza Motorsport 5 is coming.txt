 Around the launch of Forza Motorsport 4 I wrote a number of in depth posts about the work of the Turn 10 team. It may be time to revisit the crew to chat with them about Forza Motorsport 5 as it looks amazing. The level of detail has been cranked up a few more notches and the AI system has become more human. Oh and there will be IndyCar’s and F1 cars including the 1976 McLaren M23 and the 1976 Ferrari 312-2. Sweet!And the McLaren P1 will be there too. Check it out in the video above where one of only two P1’s in the world is on stage with Dan Greenawalt at E3.Mine is already pre-ordered. Bring it on.
