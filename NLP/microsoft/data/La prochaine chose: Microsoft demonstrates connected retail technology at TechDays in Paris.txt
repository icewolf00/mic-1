Intelligent systems — what we used to call embedded technology before we realized the term sort of understates what can happen when you connect customized devices and data — promises to revolutionize a number of industries.In particular, retail, where sales can happen anywhere on the floor and customers want to have the same access to products and services online as they do in the store. At Microsoft TechDays in Paris this week, European partners demonstrated technology solutions for retail, and intelligent systems were a highlight of the event. The Windows Embedded Newsroom shows how a trip to the cinema can be made easier with intelligent systems for buying tickets, checking seat availability, projecting the films and more.On the back of coolness at NRF, I think it’s time I started spending more time in retail. Tweet
