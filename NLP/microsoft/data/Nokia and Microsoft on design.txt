I got the chance to stroke another Nokia Lumia 800 this weekend – a friend of mine has the black unit and I spent ten minutes poring over it. It’s a thing of beauty and in this video a collection of Nokia and Microsoft peeps explain their inspirations for the design of the software, the hardware, and how Microsoft and Nokia came together on this phone.I think it may be time to profile Jeff Fong from the Windows Phone team here on the blog. Oh and if you haven’t met the Windows Phone design team, see them having a Mad Men moment.Tweet
