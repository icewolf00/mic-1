I downloaded Timelapse Pro for Windows Phone this morning and not a moment too soon as the snow started falling in Seattle. This simple but powerful application does a wonderful job with simple but useful controls. You fire it up, tap on a focal point for your image and it goes off snapping photos at a pre-determined interval until you stop it.It’s a well thought out app that lets you control the size of the image, the time interval and also has settings to switch off the screen to conserve the battery for a long shoot. The app also includes useful tips and tricks such as suggesting you shoot from a fixed position and use a shorter interval for more dynamic scenes.The only downside is that the results of my morning shoots aren’t available to share – that’s coming in the next version but all in all, not bad for a $1.29!thanks to @wpcentral for the tip.Tweet
