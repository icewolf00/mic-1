 Earlier today Brandon over on the Windows blog shared the video above that shows some of new capabilities coming in Windows 8.1Personally, I love seeing the continued advancement of our design philosophy in these new capabilities – much as I did with the Xbox One reveal a few weeks ago. And if you’re interested in design at Microsoft, come back on Friday when I have a real treat for you.
