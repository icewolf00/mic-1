I want you to get to know Microsoft more and here on NEXT for the last 3+ years I’ve enjoyed profiling the people of Microsoft in an attempt to do that. Microsoft is a curious collection of brilliant minds – many of whom you’ve never heard of and I’d like to change that. My role has given me the opportunity to meet amazing people and simple as it sounds, that’s what keeps me here – chance to work with people who come here every day to change the world.Today, my team is launching a new site at microsoft.com/stories/people that takes our profiles to another level. We’re starting with Andrew Kim, the acclaimed designer and owned of Minimally Minimal whose brave rebranding of Microsoft led him to a job on the Xbox team here in Seattle. Brad Anderson is our second profile – Corporate VP of our Cloud and Enterprise business as well as serial over achiever.Every week we’ll add new people to the site as we aim to show you who we are, where we work and why we work here.We have a few other things up our sleeves to help you get to know us too so be sure to bookmark www.microsoft.com/stories as we’re embarking on the next stage of our journey to take you behind the scenes at Microsoft. I hope you enjoy it.
