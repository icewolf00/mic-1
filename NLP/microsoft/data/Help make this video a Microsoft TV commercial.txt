Joe Belfiore just announced that the video above, created by Brandon Foy, will become an official Microsoft TV commercial if it gets over 200k views on YouTube. If it doesn’t sail past that count by end of today I’ll be stunned. Do your part and click to watch.…and then share it on. Right now it’s showing 302 views…Brandon was the guy behind the fan video that I mentioned back in February (last ad on that page) which a ton of people suggested should become an official ad. Well the Windows Phone team listened and invited him to create the opening video spot for MIX. Now it’s close to becoming a commercial. <!--
