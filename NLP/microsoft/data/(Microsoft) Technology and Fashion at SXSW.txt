If you happen to be at SXSW this week and have a gap in your schedule on Monday, head over to the Technology and Fashion session which aims to “show the language of art and design expressed through the intertwining of technology and fashion”. My friend Sheridan Martin will be there along with a dress she co-created – you may have seen it around these parts – The Printing Dress.Sheridan shares the session with Alison Lewis, founder of Agent of Presence, Janet Hansen, Chief Fashion Engineer at Enlighted Designs Inc., and Ping Fu, Founder & CEO of Geomagic Inc.The details can be found on the SXSW schedule site and belowI imagine it’ll be a fun session and if you can’t attend, here is some of what you’re missingTweet
