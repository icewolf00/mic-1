 Nope, that’s not a speling mistake – you can download the awesome NUIVerse application that shows the power of PixelSense on the Samsung SUR40. You may have seen the demo David Brown gave at Worldwide Partner Conference a few months back – he’s now made the app available to anyone.Of course you need an SUR40 to run it on but I know a few folks who read this blog who have a unit so go grab it and enjoy! There is a ton of documentation from Dave too. If you don’t have an SUR40, just sit back and enjoy again the amazing demo from WPC.Share
