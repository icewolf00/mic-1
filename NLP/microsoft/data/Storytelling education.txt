 The question I get asked most often these days isn’t “when will Windows 8 ship” or “what’s the coolest thing you’ve seen” – it’s “how did you get that job title; storyteller?”. The answer isn’t that interesting and honestly I’m still trying the title on for size. I’m not sure it’s the right fit but it does accurately describe what I’m trying to do here – to tell a story about Microsoft. One that hasn’t been told before. I’m still learning about this trade of storytelling – I probably always will be. A mentor of mine once told me that the best way to learn is to sit at the feet of the best and watch. And learn.   As storytellers go, the best of the best in my humble opinion is Sir Ken Robinson. He’s truly brilliant – funny, serious, inspiring, education and frankly a hero. It sorta helps that he’s from Liverpool, England, same as me. One day I’ll get to meet Sir Ken, I know it’s meant to be but for now I can watch and learn from him from afar. I’ve watched his TED talks over and over, analyzing how he unravels his stories and the theater with which he delivers them. …and now this short video of behind the TED talk that gives you a little glimpse in to some more of Sir Ken and Raghava KK. If you’re in the business of telling stories it’s worth the watch. At the very least, you should check out Sir Ken’s first talk at TED. Within 5 minutes he has the audience eating of out his hand. Truly brilliant.
