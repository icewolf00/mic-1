Netflix “Just for Kids” is a custom Netflix app on Xbox 360 designed exclusively for children 12. It makes it reassuringly safe for kids to browse and watch a large selection of kid-friendly TV shows and movies without wading through all the non kids stuff. Titles are organized by kids friendly genres such as superheroes, princesses, dinosaurs and girl power and include clear and simple descriptions. Oh and if you have a Kinect sensors, kids can drive whole experience with their voice.Love it.thanks to Major Nelson for the details.Tweet
