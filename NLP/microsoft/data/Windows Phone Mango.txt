I really ought to find out the etymology of the code names from the phone guys someday, but for now, here’s a list of all the new things coming in this release. Just kidding….there are a ton of great new features but I’m not going to list them.

JoeB takes us through the capabilities. Check out more on the Windows Phone blog and News Center…oh and Techmeme Tweet
