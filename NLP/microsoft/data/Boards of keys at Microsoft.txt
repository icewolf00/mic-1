&amp;amp;amp;amp;#160;Over the last year, I’ve been a big proponent of design at Microsoft – there are a ton of amazing designers here doing beautiful work on products such as Xbox, Surface, Office, Windows 8, Windows Phone 8 as well as PC hardware such as the Wedge Mouse and Wedge Keyboard.The new Limited Edition Touch Covers for Surface are another example of those design skills in action – which is why I love the video above of Kate Bailey, an industrial designer at Microsoft. And one of my favorite places on our campus makes a cameo too – the model shop, home to some BIG 3D printers.It turns out to have been a busy week for keyboards with an excellent post over on the Surface blog about the making of Touch Cover for Microsoft Surface…and then earlier today, Tom Warren joined the party with a great post on The Verge about “Microsoft’s top-secret Surface prototypes”. Some great photography from Mr. Warren in particular.
