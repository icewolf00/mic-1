I’ve posted a few times about The Garage here at Microsoft, most recently highlighting the Science Fair that Josh Lowensohn and I toured around. I bumped in to my friends from Channel 9 at the Fair and they’ve just posted a video showing you what it’s all about. Wanna see some Microsoft side projects? Check out the video…oh and you get to see the famous volcano. That was an entirely new thing to me but apparently it’s par for the course at any self respecting Science Fair<!--
