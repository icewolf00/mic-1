At the start of the week, I mentioned it was the one year anniversary of Kinect and showed the new Kinect Effect advert. Now at the end of the week, I’d like to introduce you to the new Kinect for Windows website.In fact it’s more than just a website – it really kick starts the journey for the Kinect for Windows commercial program that’s coming in early 2012. We already have over 200 applicants on our pilot program, including Toyota, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Razorfish and more than 25 Fortune 500 companies. There is a ton of excitement and anticipation about what’s possible with Kinect. The new website has an accompanying blog, Facebook page and Twitter handle but best of all – this also marks the release of beta 2 of the Kinect for Windows SDK. The updated SDK is ready for download and includes some important updates includingAs Craig Eisler, General Manager, Kinect for Windows mentions in the inaugural blog post, this year, we’re showing the world how to re-imagine entertainment.  Next year, with Kinect for Windows, we will help the world re-imagine everything else.Tweet
