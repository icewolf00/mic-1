New York Fashion Week got into full swing last week and it seems I’m not the only one at Microsoft who’s trading in their pocket protector for something a bit more fashion forward. The Windows 8 and Microsoft BizSpark teams both took part in the Hearst Fashion Hack, which was held in the atrium of Hearst Tower. Over a span of 24 hours teams of coders, fashion students and industry bigwigs worked together cranking out fashion-related appsPSFK first brought the  hackathon to my attention and Hearst’s involvement in this space is a bit of an affirmation of our belief in the convergence of fashion and technology. I touched on this in a blog post about our work with the Style Coalition at last fall’s Fashion Week, and Kim Stocks also mentioned it in a post about her time at NRF 2013.
