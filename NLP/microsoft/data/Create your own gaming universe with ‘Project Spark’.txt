If you’ve been following the action over at gamescom this week, you know that the Xbox team has shared lots of new details about Xbox One’s features and game lineup. (Not the least of which is the welcome addition of two new racetracks for ‘Forza Motorsport 5,’ I might add.)The event also brought the exciting news that ‘Project Spark,’ the innovative new gaming platform that lets you create, play and share your own games, will be in public beta this October. You can get an inside look at ‘Project Spark’ and meet some key members of its creative team in this story on the Fire Hose today. It’s a great read.
