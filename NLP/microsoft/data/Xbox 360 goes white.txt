There is something alluring about white technology – I can’t wait to see the Nokia Lumia 800 and 900 in white for example. The world of Xbox got a splash of white this week with the announcement of the Xbox 360 Special Edition 4GB Kinect Family Bundle. The limited edition bundle includes a glossy white Xbox 360 4GB console, glossy white Kinect sensor, white Xbox 360 wireless controller and a copy of two of the most popular Kinect tiles: Kinect Sports and Kinect Adventures. All of that and a three month subscription to Xbox LIVE Gold will be available while supplies last for US $ 299.99. I’m tempted just to get a white Kinect sensor!Major Nelson has all of the details including high res images on his Flickr account and a video for Inside XboxTweet
