Forza Horizon has already laid down some serious rubber since the launch last month and The November Bondurant Car Pack brings a new set of serious motors to your virtual garage. My personal favorite is the 2010 BMW M3 GTS but if that’s not your things, there is sure to be something that meets your needs as it includes The pack became available earlier this week and each car is available for 240 MS Points, or you can grab all of them for 400 MS points. A steal.
