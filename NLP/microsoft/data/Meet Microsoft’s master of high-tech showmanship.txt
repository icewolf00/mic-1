Editor’s note: The following is a post from Steve Wiens, editor of microsoft.com/stories. You might have seen Ryan Asdourian in action before. He’s often on stage delivering high-profile demos of Microsoft devices and services at company events. But seeing him in “Blitz Mode” as the green-feathered mascot of the Seattle Seahawks is something else altogether.“He goes from a sparkling conversationalist to a silent bird whose communicative currency includes a large catalog of exaggerated gestures, dance moves, high-fives, thumbs ups, raise the roofs and so forth,” writes Jennifer Warnick in a profile of Asdourian published today at Microsoft.com/Stories.Whether Asdourian is in Blitz Mode, showing off Microsoft’s latest and greatest on stage, or raising money for the National MS Society, he brings both sparkling showmanship and level-headed dedication to his work.Read his story at Microsoft.com/Stories.
