For the last few weeks I’ve had my Bing settings changed from the US homepage to UK. Given my British roots, it’s given me a chance to see the daily Bing image from a UK perspective and during the Olympic Games, the images were pretty inspiring. The US homepage had some great images too and you can see a snapshot of both via Long Zheng’s Bing Image Archive (or click the back arrow at the lower right of the image on Bing.com).These were a few of my favorites.Share
