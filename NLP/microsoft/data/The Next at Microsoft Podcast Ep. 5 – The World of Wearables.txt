Welcome to the fifth episode of the Next at Microsoft podcast series. In this edition, Desney Tan, Microsoft principal researcher, and Amish Patel, director of experiences and design for the Personal Devices Group at Microsoft, talk about wearable technology (such as the Microsoft Band) and whole body computing.Desney and Amish chat about making technology more accessible using combinations of sensors and analytics that make sense of what we do through measurable actions like running, walking and sleeping. Devices, they say, give us opportunities to personalize the technology experience to achieve our personal goals, which vary from person to person.Wearables also help us understand ourselves better through tracking all the signals our bodies put out every day as we go about life. That technology evolved from devices like the Kinect, which captures what the body does in living rooms. In the future, we could see notifications based on body cues like movement and heart rate. This could help us detect health issues early on and enable us to take a proactive approach to healthcare.Direct Download – Subscribe via iTunes – Subscribe via RSSTune in to the podcast and check out the trailer video above.
