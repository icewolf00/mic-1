 Well I’m finally back in Seattle, back from the action of New York Fashion Week and a great few days working with Bloomingdale’s, FaceCake, Industrial Color and Style Coalition.I’m also back to a lot of emails with colleagues telling me I have the best job in Microsoft. I’m not sure about that as some of these people have pretty sweet jobs that have WAY more impact that I do – but I will confess that I have a lot of fun and get to do some terrific stuff with a great team that helps to show a side of Microsoft that not everyone notices. This week and last happened to be about the many ways that Microsoft is involved in the fashion industry, and during my conversations throughout NYFW I was surprised that people we’re more surprised at Microsoft’s involvement. Maybe there is a growing sense of Microsoft being savvy about design and the creative industries.Though I’m back from Fashion Week, it’s far from being over with official events running until tomorrow and Bloomingdale’s HOT campaign still in full effect. In fact, you still have a chance to win an epic bundle of Microsoft technology by texting “ITSON” to 51515 (US residents only).The sweepstakes runs through Sept 16th and one Ultimate Grand Prize winner will take home a Windows tablet, Microsoft Wedge Touch Mouse and Wedge Mobile Keyboard, Xbox 360 with Kinect, Nokia Lumia 900 Windows Phone and more. Forty first prize winners will also receive a Windows tablet and Microsoft Wedge Touch Mouse and Keyboard.You can also still stop by one of twenty Bloomingdale’s stores around the US to experience Swivel, a virtual dressing room and style advisor from FaceCake, and the Microsoft Research Printing Dress will be in the NYC 59th Street store until September 16th.Next stop, London, Milano, Paris!
