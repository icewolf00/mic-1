As I mentioned a few weeks ago, I was delighted to speak at the recent PSFK event in New York City and share some views on how technology is becoming more natural. Yesterday, PSFK published the video of my talk which you can view above. As I mention at the beginning of the talk I really do get paid to do my hobby here at Microsoft…but please don’t tell anyone! If you’re interested in the future of technology as I am, you may find it an interesting 20 minutes or so.I’d also strongly encourage you to check out some of the other speakers, most notably Grant McCracken and Todd Carmichael but also Abe Burmeister, Jonathan Harris and Clay Shirky.thanks again to PSFK for putting on such a great event and be sure to check out their upcoming London event.   Tweet
