 A little detail I love on Windows Phone is how it deals with Bing’s image of the day. I first noticed then when Bing had an image of The Highline in New York City – when you rotate the device between portrait and landscape, the image adjusts accordingly and often results in seeing a different image. in The case above, from 3 camels to 2 and a detail within that detail is how the hotspots on the image also adapt. Nice.
