Everyone knows what Harlow’s Monkeys are right? Well if you don’t you will by the end of this talk from Stevie Bathiche. You may have read about Stevie and the work of the Applied Sciences Team he manages here at Microsoft as I’ve mentioned him a few times on this blog and he was on the front page of The Seattle Times last month.I asked Stevie if he’d be interested in attending (IMHO) the best conference in the UK, Thinking Digital, earlier this year and he graciously agreed. This is the result of his talk which I remember being warmly received at the time.Enjoy.Tweet
