I’m excited to announce the availability of the Next at Microsoft app in the Windows Store. From day one on Next (over 2 years ago) my intention has been to bring you stories from across Microsoft and get behind the scenes of trends such as Natural User Interface and Big Data as well as profile the work of the people I meet from Microsoft Research, our incubation labs, designers, developers and more.Telling those stories visually has been at the core of Next and the magazine style approach to the blog has been carried over in to the application – I want to make the stories visual and easy to share and I hope you find we’ve achieved that. Performance was also a key goal so you can speed through the content with a flick and not be distracted by unnecessary bells and whistles. This is our v1 and there are a number of areas we’re busy at work on for v2 (live tile, search, inline video etc.) so install the app (it’s free), kick the tires and tell us what you like and don’t like in the reviews on here on the blog.thanks for your ongoing support of Next at Microsoft. Steve
