I blogged last month about the Firenze student competition than ran here on our Redmond campus over a weekend. This video captures the key moments of the weekend and gives you a glimpse in to what it’s all about and what it means to Microsoft execs and students. It was great to hear Brie, Ross and others talk about how it changed her perception of Microsoft. You also get to see Studio B, one of the main places I tend to hang out on campus as a ton of interesting stuff goes down in that building. Oh and they have the cool LED screens hanging from the ceilings in there…more on that in a Friday post I think. <!--
