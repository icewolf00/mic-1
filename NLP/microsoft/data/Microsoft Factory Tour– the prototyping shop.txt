In this final video touring Microsoft Research (MSR) places, Tom Blank takes Larry Larsen around the Prototyping Shop. Our teams in MSR are constantly building gadgets & widgets as they test out their ideas and this shop allows them to make use of laser cutting machines, 3D plastic printers, lathes and milling machines. I took a tour around the shop myself a few weeks ago and can confirm that it’s way tidier than my old woodworking shop at school. Like the anechoic chamber from last week, this is just one of the hardware “labs” inside Microsoft and in a few weeks I hope to take you behind the scenes of the Microsoft Hardware model shop where keyboard and mice prototypes are made by hand. For now, enjoy this one. <!--
