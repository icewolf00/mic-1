Some really cool gaming experiences have come to IE 10 over the last few months—classic arcade games like Asteroids and Centipede. And in October came the news that  Contre Jour was also going to be available. Today the IE team released an additional 20 levels. If you’re a fan of Petit then this can only be seen as great news. Get more details on the Exploring IE blog.
