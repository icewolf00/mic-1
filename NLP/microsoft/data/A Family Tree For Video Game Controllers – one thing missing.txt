 [full size version]I stumbled across this infographic recently at FastCo Design – it’s from Pop Chart Lab and shows the family tree for video games controllers. While it’s beautiful, it’s missing one thing. An image of you. Sure, Kinect is on there but Kinect isn’t really the controller – you are.Anyway…it’s still a great infographic but I’d love to see them add a small icon of a person as the lineage beyond Kinect Tweet
