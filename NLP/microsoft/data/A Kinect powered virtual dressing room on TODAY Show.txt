There is some irony that Iâ€™m posting about a spot on the TODAY show that ran yesterday ðŸ˜‰Last September I met Katie Linendoll as part of our New York Fashion Week activities and showed her FaceCakeâ€™s Swivel â€“ an digital fitting room powered by Kinect for Windows. On the TODAY show yesterday, Katie showed the technology in action along with a host of other tech + fashion creations.On the accompanying blog post from the TODAY show, itâ€™s cool to see how Swivel has advanced since September, notably with Swivel Close-up that allows virtual makeup bars. As Katie notes, score one for us germophobes!
