Okay, technically this isn’t a photo from “around Microsoft” but it’s too good to pass up. I originally did have a photograph taken on campus to share but when I saw Bing.com today I had to share this instead. It’s a stunning waterfront shot of my hometown, Liverpool.Why Liverpool today? Bing it marking the formation of a little known musical quartet.Credit to McCoy Wynne/Alamy
