On day 1 at CES, one of the main attractions of the Microsoft booth was the What’s Next space – not least because of the presence of FaceCake, a Microsoft partner, with their Swivel virtual fitting room application. All day long people have been lining up to try out clothes using this Kinect powered system and I grabbed some time with Tom Chamberlin before the show opened to find out more and give it a try myself. I also got the chance to try on The Printing Dress that I blogged about earlier today.If you’re at CES, stop by and try out the dress and other fashions yourself – virtually. And if you want to know more about how this type of application is possible, check out the Kinect for Windows site.Tweet
