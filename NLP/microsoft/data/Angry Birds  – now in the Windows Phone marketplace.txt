I was just putting the finishing touches to a Windows Phone post for tomorrow when I noticed a post from Michael over on the Windows Phone team blog. It seems the much anticipated Angry Birds is now in the Windows Phone Marketplace.I’ll be honest and say this isn’t a craze I’ve been sucked in to (yet) but for many, it’s a must have. It’s free to try and $2.99 to buy.Tweet
