As I head home from a great week at CES, I thought I’d share what my out of office message has been for the week. In case you can’t read the text, it says CES, CES, CES…that’s all you’ll hear this week. Well, that’s all you’ll hear from me and it’s going to be all CES all the time on www.microsoft.com/nextAs for your email, it’s lounging in my CES green room, attended by a fleet of SMTP masseurs who are peeling it grapes and dipping them in vintage champagne until I get a free moment and can respond with some far less exiting than this OOF. If that’s not enough and you feel an urgent need to contact me, send a text to +1 206 …. ….. For anything more urgent, send a tweet with the hashtag #printingdress. All will be revealed (literally) during the show.  In the meantime, chill – it’s CES week. SteveTweet
