Harry Shum - Executive Vice President, Technology and Research

By now, you’ve probably seen that the new Office launched globally just a couple of days ago on Sept. 22 — we’re thrilled to see how it is already offering new ways for people to work together.In my role leading Microsoft’s Technology and Research (TnR) group, a big part of my job is to bring long-term research discoveries to the product teams, a process that involves a lot of close collaboration. In today’s workplace, information is everywhere, with fewer and fewer barriers to access. But in a world where information flows faster than ever before, just transferring information doesn’t necessarily mean better collaboration. We believe that collaboration is made better when intelligence, inference, context and intent are applied.Today, I want to talk about how some of the collaboration between research and Office teams has resulted in new features that can empower people and their teams to do and achieve more. Let me share just a few examples of many in the new Office….Clearly, the role that collaboration plays is huge. In this case, it meant that the efforts of long-term research combined with the great work of our product teams to deliver the new Office that empowers individuals and teams to do and achieve more. We in Technology and Research are really excited about what the new Office can do to help reinvent productivity and our role and contributions in helping the Office team deliver on that promise. Check out the new Office today and find out for yourself how it can take the work out of working together.Harry Shum is the executive vice president Microsoft’s Technology and Research group.
