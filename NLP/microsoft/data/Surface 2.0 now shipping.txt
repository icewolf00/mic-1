I spent a lot of time with Surface 2.0 last week and from this morning onwards, others can begin to have the same pleasure – the SUR 40 is now shipping and available through Samsung channel and reseller partners. Samsung announced the news this morning at the National Retail Federation Conference 2012 in New York. Shipments to customers will begin later this month with an estimated street pricing (MAP) for U.S. customers starting at $8,400 (display only) and $9,049 (tabletop unit with matching stand). Pricing for other countries and/or regions may differ.The SUR 40 won a CES Best of Innovations 2012 award – the 40-inch full HD LCD can be mounted horizontally or vertically and incorporates PixelSense – as I explain in the video below, this enables the LCD to “see: and detect objects. It also boasts a whopping chunk of Gorilla glass that makes it extremely durable in conditions such as retail environments, hospitality settings and a crammed CES booth.Check out this video of me demonstrating the SUR 40 in action last week in Vegas and below that, the tech specs I was repeatedly asked during the demos. Also, be sure to check out our NRF newsroom for lots more on putting shoppers in control of the retail experience. HDMI / stereo RCA / SPDIF / (2) 3.5mm audio out jacksBrightness300 CD/m2Communications1GB Ethernet/802.11/BTContrast Ratio2000:1CPUAMD Athlon X2 245e 2.9GHz Dual CoreDisplay ResolutionFull HD 1080p 1920×1080 / 16:9 ratioGPUAMD Radeon HD 6750 1GB GDDRSHDD320GBHDMI In / HDMI OutI/O Ports4 USB, SD Card ReaderOperating SystemWindows 7 Professional for Embedded Systems 64-bitOperating Temp.Max ambient 30CPanel Size40” DiagonalProtection GlassGorilla GlassRAM4 GB DDR3 RAMSystem Management ToolsDMFT DASH SupportWeight – with std. legs50.4 kg / 111.1 lbsWeight – standalone36.8 kg / 81.1 lbsTweet
