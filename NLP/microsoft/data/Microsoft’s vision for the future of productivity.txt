Via a post on the Official Microsoft Blog today, Kurt DelBene announced a new video that shows our vision on the future of productivity. You may have seen my post earlier this week that explored how far Microsoft and the industry has gone in achieving the vision laid out in an earlier vision video. This video carries forward many of the themes we laid out there, as well as introducing some new ones. Natural user interfaces, displays everywhere, an ecosystem of devices, cloud computing are consistent. New themes emerge in this video such as technology working on our behalf, and context plays a much bigger part in many scenes.As Kurt notes in his post, this vision is no flight of fancy – all of the ideas contained in the video are based on real technology – from Microsoft and others. Some of the capabilities in the video are here and now (such as real time collaboration), while others are some way off. You can find more info on the video at office.com/visionOver the next few weeks, with the help of the team behind the video, I’ll dig in to the scenes in some more detail. We’ll explain what’s going on and what technology is at play – joining the dots to show you how this future may come to pass. [update] Todd Bishop at GeekWire has a great post on this and it’s trickling along on Techmeme.Tweet
