Youâ€™ve got Kinect, youâ€™ve got a Windows Phone? Then I assume you have got the Xbox Companion App for Windows Phone? If not, grab it now. Iâ€™ve been playing with it for a month and itâ€™s beautifully integrated. Search for content from your phone, hit play and it starts playing on your Xbox. Thatâ€™s just one of itâ€™s tricks thoughâ€¦you can find more details about the movie, TV show, music or game that is playing on your Xbox and view friend activity to see who is online, achievements and additional info.LMFAOâ€¦grab it for free now.â€¦oh and if you have an iOS device, we have an app for you too. Not quite the same, but it brings some Metro love to iOS ðŸ™‚Tweet
