  This infographic is one I came across in late 2012 that has been used by the Microsoft recruitment team to show the wide and varied careers available at the company. Whether it’s search, cloud, social, NUI, gaming, developer tools, phones, Windows, Kinect – there is something for everyone at Microsoft. Check out careers.microsoft.com for more.  To embed this infographic on your blog simply copy and paste the code below. A higher res PDF version is also available [update] and I just added a link to the high res JPEG from the image above…which a few peeps had pointed out I’d missed 😉  <img src=”http://blogs.technet.com/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-80-73-Blogpost/2626.MSFT-Tech.jpg” width=”540″> <p>Microsoft Technologies – An infographic by the team from <a href=”www.microsoft.com/next”>Next at Microsoft</a></p>
