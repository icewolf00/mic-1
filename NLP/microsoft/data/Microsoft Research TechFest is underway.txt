Last week was a popular one on this blog as we covered some of the technology demonstrations from Craig Mundie’s TechForum event here on Microsoft Campus in Redmond, WA.This week we’ll have even more hot new technology demos to show you as Microsoft Research TechFest is under way this morning. We fill building 33 on our main campus with the latest and greatest projects from Microsoft Research locations around the world. For me, it’s one the highlights of the year as I get to wander the halls and chat with the people building the future – it’s like being invited to the most advanced science fair you’ve ever seen.Today, we open the event to select media and customers so I’ll get to show you what they see. Check back later today and tomorrow for more coverage and you can also follow along on the MSR Facebook page, MSR Twitter handle and the Inside MSR blog. In the meantime, take a look at my favorite demonstrations from TechForum. Illumishare HoloflectorBehind the Screen Overlay InteractionsTweet
