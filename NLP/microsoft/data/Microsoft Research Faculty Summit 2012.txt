I’ll be busy in Atlanta this week so sadly will miss attending the Microsoft Research Faculty Summit that’s running tomorrow and Tuesday at our Redmond HQ. Fortunately you can follow along at the Virtual Event site where keynotes and other sessions will be streamed.What is Faculty Summit? Well every year, Microsoft Research hosts this event to bring together leading academic researchers and educators with Microsoft researchers to explore the latest research results and discuss the big challenges they’re collectively looking to solve. Keynote speakers this year include Microsoft Research Distinguished Scientist Eric Horvitz and Rick Rashid, Microsoft Research’s Chief Research Officer.You can also follow on Twitter with the hashtag #FacSummTweet
