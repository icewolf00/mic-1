&amp;amp;amp;amp;#160;Forza usually means Friday around – or is it the other way around? Anyhow, December’s car pack is in the shape of the IGN Car Pack and it includes some epic motors, not least of which are the 2012 Ferrari F12berlinetta and the 1993 McLaren F1.  I shall be taking them both for a spin this weekend and suggest you do the same.
