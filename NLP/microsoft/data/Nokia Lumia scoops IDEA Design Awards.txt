Last year I wrote about the 3 awards the Windows Phone software was awarded by the The Industrial Designers Society of America. The IDEA awards program is considered by many as the ‘Oscars’ of design competitions – not least as it’s judged by the experts in their field. Last week, the society announced this years winners and once again, Windows Phone did well – this time for hardware.Our friends at Nokia picked up award for both the Lumia 800 and 900 in the communication tools category.The Jury said, “In a market in which it is difficult to stand out, the Nokia Lumia brings a fresh perspective. The iconic form is personal and inviting without sacrificing precision, and the construction is modern, efficient and well-crafted down to the smallest details. It’s a bold, gold-worthy effort, and I’m glad to see Nokia reclaim its design swagger.” Jonah Becker, Principal and Creative Director, One & Co. Congrats to Nokia and a brief word for our Xbox Industrial Design Team who scooped a silver award for the Xbox 360 Wireless Speed Wheel.Tweet
