Back in February I profiled Lindsey Kujawski, an industrial designer at Microsoft who I titled as a “fashionista”. She spends time looking at the latest fashion, interior design and macro-social trends. The aim is is to help design products that connect with people beyond the features and functionality – which is what the Artist Edition mice are all about. Announced last week, the Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 has been transformed with with artwork commissioned by five premier artists from around the world:For a closer at all the patterns in the new collection or some background on the group of artists, check out the Artist Edition website. I’m hopeful that I can convince Lindsay to add Banksy or EINE to the next collection. Tweet
