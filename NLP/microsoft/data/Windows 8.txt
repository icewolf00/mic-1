Steve Clayton - Editor - Microsoft News Center Staff

This afternoon at the D9 conference, Steven Sinofsky talked publicly about Windows 8 for the first time and was followed with a demo from Julie Larson Green. Without a live video feed, I sat and “watched” the show via Twitter as a cast of hundreds (it seems) live tweeted the even giving blow by blow coverage.No doubt there will be much analysis in the hours, days and months to follow. For now, I’ll point you to the  Microsoft News Center and Windows blog. Be sure to check out the video on the News Center that shows the new user interface (or on YouTube) and head over to D9 as I’m sure they’ll post the interview with Steven very soon. A fun day here in Microsoft HQ but lots of work ahead. [update] it looks like the place to be if you want to hear more about Windows 8 will be the BUILD conference in Anaheim this September. Tweet
