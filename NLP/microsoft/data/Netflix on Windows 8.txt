I was just thinking this morning, wouldn’t it be nice to have a Netflix app on my Windows 8 tablet…and my Windows 8 PC at work. Lo and behold, the official Netflix app just landed in the Windows Store. And from a quick first play, it looks sweet, fast and of course, fluid.If you’re running the Windows 8 RTM, head to the store now to download and install for free. Ignore the titles in my personal catalog shown above – that’s what happens when you have a 3 year old in the house. I’m now sat at my desk at work watching Netflix in snap view on Windows 8 as shown below – work and play, work and play. Sweet.
