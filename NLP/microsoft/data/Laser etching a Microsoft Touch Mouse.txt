I posted about the Artist Edition of our Touch Mouse recently and today the hardware team released this short video of the laser etching process. I can’t help wondering if I take my laptop down there if they’d etch my creation on to the lid. Hmmm.Anyhoo, the Artist Edition should be on it’s way to me soon (I hope) so expect more photos and a review in the coming weeks.Tweet
