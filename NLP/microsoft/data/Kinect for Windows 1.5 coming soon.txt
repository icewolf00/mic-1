This capability works in both default and near mode. Also coming in the 1.5 release is Kinect Studio, an application that will allow developers to record, playback and debug clips of users engaging with their applications as well as four new languages for speech recognition – French, Spanish, Italian and Japanese.Head over to the Kinect for Windows blog to find out more.Tweet
