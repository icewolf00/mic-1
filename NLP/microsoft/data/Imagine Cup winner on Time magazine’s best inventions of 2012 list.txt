Remember team QuadSquad, winners of the 2012 Imagine Cup? The Ukrainian team won the software design category with Enable Talk, a project that enables deaf individuals to communicate verbally using custom-designed sensory gloves and a smartphone application to translate sign language gestures into speech.I had the chance to see a live demo of Enable Talk this summer and it was stunning. Time Magazine appears to have been similarly impressed as the project has made their Best Inventions of the Year list.Congrats to the team and we we wish them well as they take their amazing invention out to the world. If you haven’t seen Enable Talk in action, check out the demo below and find out more about the team at enabletalk.com
