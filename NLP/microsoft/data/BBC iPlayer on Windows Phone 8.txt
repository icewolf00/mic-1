This is really a geotargeted post for my followers and friends in the UK. I’m sure those of them toting a Windows Phone are dancing with glee to hear that BBC’s iPlayer is now available for Windows Phone 8. As Dave Price, Head of BBC iPlayer, announced in a blog post the application enables users to catch up with their favourite BBC shows on the go and he noted that in March this year 30% of overall requests came from mobiles or tablets, with 81 million requests in total.I’m hoping it comes to the US soon too – personally I’d happily pay for CBeebies, Top Gear, The Apprentice and more.In the meantime, if you’re in the UK you can grab the app from the Window Phone Store.
