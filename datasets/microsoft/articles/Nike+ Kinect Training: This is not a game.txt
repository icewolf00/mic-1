&amp;amp;#160;My Nike Flyknit shoes arrived last week and they’re ready for a run out – but to be honest, I’m a bit of a fair weather runner and the rain has set in here in Seattle. Just in time though, Nike+ Kinect Training is available on Xbox. This is no game…no, no. This is full personalized fitness program and within moments of testing it out yesterday I was sweating and my family were laughing. That was mainly as I was sliding around on my wooden floor in socks so for my next workout, the Flyknit’s are being worn. The app has definitely got me intrigued as it’s very professionally done and most important, gives you way to track your performance with Nike Fuel. I’m going to give it a try for a few weeks. Oh and there is now an Windows Phone app to complement the experience. Just do it.
