 Not Microsoft related but I have design on the mind this week so wanted to share this beautiful video of Mike Friton, a freelance shoemaker, weaver, paper sculptor and Nike alumni. I have a few friends in design at Microsoft who are ex-Nike I’m hoping to bring to the blog over the coming weeks. The video reminded me of some of their work and the work that goes on in places such as the Model Shop at Microsoft.Props to cineastas for a wonderful video.
