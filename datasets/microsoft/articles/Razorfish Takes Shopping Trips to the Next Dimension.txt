 The guys over at RazorFish have been busy in their lab, improving upon the 5D shopping experience that they unleashed at last year’s NRF EXPO. Judging from the video, it seems they’ve pulled out all the stops. Razorfish 5D uses Kinect for Windows and the Samsung SUR40 with Microsoft Pixelsense, along with a bunch of supporting technologies–near field communication, QR codes and multi-touch, to name a few. Together it creates a shopping experience that’s unlike anything you’ve seen before. Audi was so impressed they chose Razorfish 5D to power the Audi City store in London.This year, Razorfish has added augmented reality and transparent displays into the mix. You can also synchronize content across devices and operating systems, and let your spouse or significant other shop with you, even if they chose to stay home. I could definitely get in to that.
