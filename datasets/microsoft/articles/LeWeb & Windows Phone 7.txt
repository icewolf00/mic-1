I’ll be in Paris this week but sadly not at Le Web – though I may try to swing by as it’s one of the hottest conferences in Europe. It brings together the best of the web folk from Europe with their counterparts from the West Coast of the USA. This year, it also brings together Le Web and Windows Phone 7 with a new application that arrived in to the Windows Phone 7 Marketplace today. For those at the conference it’s a handy application for checking out speakers and timings but perhaps even more useful for those of us not attending as it’ll be a way to keep up with the LeWeb chatter and photos. If you’re attending LeWeb and toting a Windows Phone 7, here’s my recommendation of other apps you may want to load up. Any others we’re missing?Tweet
