It’s been a while since I posted anything about Forza Motorsport 4 but the latest video from the team at Turn 10 is too good not to share here. As I’ve mentioned in previous posts, the people behind Forza 4 are serious about attention to detail. This latest video shows how much work goes in to the recreation of a vehicle in the game – from sub centimeter accuracy to the visual recreation of the car, to very close attention to the soundtrack of each car.….and then the team turn it up a few notches with the Autovista feature of the game – something they consider akin to a level in the game. This is where you get to step inside a selection of vehicles and experience them in incredible detail.I’m still making my way through the game and with more cars being added as downloadable content, it’s going to keep me busy for quite some time….my latest favorites, the Audi Sport quattro S1 and the Audi Sport North America R18 TDI  Tweet
