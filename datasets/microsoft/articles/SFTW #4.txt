Even though I’ve worked at Microsoft for over 13 years, visiting Redmond (our HQ) was always intriguing. There was a sense of this is where the sausage (okay, software) gets made. I used to enjoy exploring the campus and finding cultural indicators – be they arcade machines in Building 17 or the warehouse like space where the Zune team lived for a while. The truth is, I still enjoy this stuff and every day I wander the corridors, snapping photos of things I find fun, or creative or interesting. It may be just me that finds this stuff interesting but hopefully not – I think it’s one way of helping shed a little more light on who Microsoft is, how we work and where we work. With that in mind, Something for the Weekend #4 is an old skool poster I found in Studio B, home to lots of hardware folks here at Microsoft. I’d love to know if you want to see more of this…or less!<!--
