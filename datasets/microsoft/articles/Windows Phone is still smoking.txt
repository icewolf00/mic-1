My pal Ben The PC Guy (will he ever change to Ben the Phone Guy?) has been at work on the streets of Seattle – nope, not busking but doing some more smoking with Windows Phone. For those new to the concept, Ben has been challenging all comers to beat common smartphone tasks since January of this year. At CES he setup shop outside the What’s Next booth and was victorious over iPhone’s and Android phones of all flavors as he challenged them to find restaurants, post to Facebook and tag their photos.Since then, the smoked by Windows Phone challenge has taken the world by storm and has been winning challenge after challenge in over 43 countries. Over 100,000,000 has seen or read about Smoked by Windows Phone and the win rate remains impressively high at 98%. A guerilla marketing goes, it’s pretty impressive.Tweet
