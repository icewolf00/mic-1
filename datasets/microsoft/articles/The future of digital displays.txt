Last month, Mashable had an interesting post on the future of digital displays that I found fascinating. Lauren Hockenson talked with experts about the rise of digital displays in airports, retail environment and our streets.This is an area Microsoft is a big believer in – and we believe that in the near future, almost every surface in our lives could become not only digital but interactive. It’s something I’ve blogged about here several times and it seems as each week passes it, more progress is being made. In the last 2 weeks, I’ve seen more projects and products that will be a big part of this trend:      I long for the flexible display tech mentioned in the Mashable post but that’s just one part of this journey we’re on where every surface is interactive. It’s set to be an exciting few years in this field, where I think the real trick will be employing all of this technology in a non-intrusive, helpful manner. More on that later this week – I’ll close by sharing the Office Vision video from late last year which shows the breath of our vision for displays. Tweet
