The latest video from the recent Underground Tour with Josh Topolosky and Chad Mumm of The Verge just posted on their site and it’s a peek inside one of my favorite places on Microsoft’s campus here in Redmond. It’s also a chat with one of my favorite people – Karsten Aagaard – his story is fantastic, a toymaker who found a job at Microsoft.Check out the video and stay tuned as I know Josh and Chad have more up their sleeves from this visit.…and no, we don’t have any of those clear glass Windows Phone lying around. Well….I may have one but that’s another story.Tweet
