Another post, another video featuring Microsoft Surface. This time, it’s nsquared, a Microsoft Partner from Australia who showed off this impressive demo during the TechEd Australia 2011 developer keynote this week.I thought the integration of Surface and Windows Phone was particularly impressive and seeing a developer using the voice capability of Kinect was also cool.As Long Zheng notes, you sometimes see this kind of integrated demo in our vision videos (or sometimes in Craig Mundie demos) but to see it in the wild is testament to what’s possible and to the capability of nsquared. Kudos to them!Tweet
