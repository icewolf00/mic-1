The BA049/048 flights are known as the “nerd bird” – the daily flight to and from London Heathrow to Seattle. I must have flown that route over 50 times in my near 14 year Microsoft career and I can pretty much guarantee there will be a Softie on board who I know. Well, now all those Softies get to catch up with their iPhone and Android toting friends as BA has released their app for Windows Phone 7.This isn’t the app I highlighted last week with the 3D cabin view as that has some dependencies on the Mango release of WP7 but in the meantime, this a great little app for tracing your flights, exec club status and carrying your boarding pass.Grab it from the Zune marketplacethanks to EwanD for the tipoffTweet
