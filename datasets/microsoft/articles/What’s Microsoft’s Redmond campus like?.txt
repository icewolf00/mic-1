Back in May I wrote a post that a colleague told me would be boring – it was about “my workplace”. I think he thought I was going to write about my desk – which I’m rarely at – and yep, that would have been boring. I count the entire campus as my workspace though which made things a bit more interesting and the post was well received.If you want to get a glimpse in to some of the lesser seen spaces and places at Microsoft HQ here in Redmond, check out A tour of my Microsoft workspace.As for the image above. Stay tuned…I’ll have more on that next week. Those folks at Facebook and Google don’t have a monopoly on cool workspaces Tweet
