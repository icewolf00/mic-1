This is the moment last week when I got to sit down and chat with Bill Gates about Windows 8, Windows Phone 8, NUI and Surface – a tiny room and a quick shoot. Bill was on great form, explaining that he got one of the first Surface units off the production line and revealing that he has the black keyboard (I have Cyan). He was engaged on all of the topics but none more so than when I asked about Surface. “Well, Surface is an unbelievably great product” he said, noting that “I’ve been using it day and night, showing it to everybody I meet on any — any topic.”Not long until we all get to play with Surface.
