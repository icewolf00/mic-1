A couple of really great stories coming out this morning about Cortana and the power behind it, or rather, her. Engadget’s Brad Molen wrote an up-close piece on the team of researchers, engineers and project managers that created Cortana’s personality.And Simon Bisson of ZDNet seemingly picked up where Brad left off, focusing more on the contributions of Microsoft Research and the  AI brawn that powers Cortana and gives her the ability to learn about your preferences and habits over time.Both stories provide a look at the impressive work that’s taken place, while tantalizing you with a glimpse of what’s to come. Do yourself a favor and read them both before leaving for the day.
