The Imagine Cup 2013 team is gearing up for the start of this year’s challenge and the first deadline to enter is coming up this Friday, February 15. So if your teenager (16 years-old and up) is getting bored with your old Heathkit, encourage them to enter. They’ll thank you for it the rest of their life.
