I’m something of a design junkie and have spent plenty of time over the last two years with designers at Microsoft. It’s been great to see the outside world recognize and even reward the design work over that time period. We can add a few more people to that list from the recent Business Insider DESIGN 75: The Best Designers In Technology. Two Microsoft designers made the list:Weighing in at #10 on the list is Joe Belfiore, Corporate VP in our Windows Phone division. I remember seeing Joe many years ago talking about Windows Media Center, in many ways a forerunner to some of the design aesthetic you see across Microsoft now, so it’s great to see him recognized.The list is chock full with other great designers – though I’d add a few more from Microsoft to the list myself. I have some more work underway right now that will bring them to life so stay tuned.For now, congrats to Nicolas and Joe.
