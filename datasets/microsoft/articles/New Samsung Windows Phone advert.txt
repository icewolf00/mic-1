The Really? and Season of the Witch adverts that accompanied the initial launch of Windows Phone 7 were great IMHO. This new advert from Samsung for the Focus changes tack by showcasing the features of Windows Phone 7. I know I (and probably you) are not the target audience for this, which is why I think it’s pretty good and timely given the $99 price of the Focus on AT&T here in the US. via wmpoweruser Also, in browsing for this video, I also found another useful one that was shown at Mobile World Congress, presumably on loop screens  
[update]A pretty nice video effort from the community too! Amazing what happens when you get people excited about your products…
