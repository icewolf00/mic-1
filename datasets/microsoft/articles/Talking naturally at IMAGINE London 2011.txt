Every now and then I get asked to talk about where technology is going and such an occasion was last month in London at the Microsoft Advertising IMAGINE London 2011 event. It took place over two days in Microsoft’s London offices and had a great lineup of speakers from inside and outside of Microsoft.I spoke for about 30 minutes about Natural User Interfaces and gave a live demo of the new Xbox 360 dashboard. The team has cut the essence of my talk down to 150 seconds which you can see above – or you can get the entire 30 minutes should you choose.Be sure to check out some of the other speakers too, not least Peter Espersen who is the global community lead at LEGO. He was hilarious as well as being very interesting about building community.Tweet
