TED released this video yesterday and it’s circulating widely on the web today. It shows Marco Tempest employing a Kinect sensor to deliver a live augmented reality presentation and it’s pretty dazzling stuff. It’s not immediately clear from the video what is going on but some photos from the TED blog help to explain – Marco is presenting on the TED stage and the AR tricks are projected on a screen behind him.Creative Applications Network has much more detail on how the performance was created including details of “global magic dust”.I’m still getting my head around…hit play and enjoy and then watch the video below to see the magic behind the magic.Tweet
