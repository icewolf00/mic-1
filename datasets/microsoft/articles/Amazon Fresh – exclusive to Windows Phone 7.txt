A good spot by Todd Bishop – Amazon Fresh launched today, exclusively for Windows Phone 7. Okay, the exclusive is in large part due to 40k Microsoft employees in the area, many who are no toting WP7 devices and the fact that Amazon Fresh is only available in Seattle.As it happens, I was in our South Lake Union office today which is deep in the new Amazon brainforest that is spreading across the area and noticed a few employees also using Windows Phone 7.Tweet
