I’m often asked where I see Kinect going next and much like the Kinect Effect advert, I put that question back on the questioner. One of the answers I give is we see it going into more and more places outside of the living room – places like schools and hospitals. In fact in the advert, there is a brief moment where you see Kinect in an operating theater.That’s not happening tomorrow, it’s happening today, at Sunnybrook hospital in Toronto. Earlier this week, Discovery Channel Canada dropped in on Sunnybrook and got a demo of how Kinect is being used.Discovery Channel also stopped by our What’s Next booth at CES where I spoke with Ziya about natural user interfaces on Surface 2.0 and with Kinect.Tweet
