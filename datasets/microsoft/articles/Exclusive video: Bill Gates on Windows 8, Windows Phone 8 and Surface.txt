I often tell people I’ve got one of the best jobs at Microsoft; I get the opportunity to meet and talk with the people here who brew the special sauce that is Microsoft. Last week I got to meet and talk with the guy who first created the sauce.Following a Microsoft event to celebrate 30 years of our Giving campaign, I sat down to chat with Bill Gates for a few minutes.  We talked about the significance of this week’s launch of Windows 8, about Windows Phone 8 and Surface. I ordered my Surface last week; Bill already has his and he’s pretty excited about it, as you‘ll see.  His keyboard’s a different color than mine, though…Hit play and enjoy!
