 Last month I reported that Windows Phone 7.5 had won an interaction design award from the Interaction Design Association’s (IxDA). It led a few people o ask my what interaction design is so rather than me (a non designer) try to explain, I thought I’d leave to the experts (and some of the judges).This is one of a series of wonderful videos by Christian Svanes.thanks to PSFK for pointing me in the right direction.Tweet
