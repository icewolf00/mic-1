Over the last few weeks I’ve highlighted the work of Second Story with the latest Kinect SDK head tracking capability and a Kinect laden installation at the World of Coca Cola.The team in Portland, Oregon has a great project I’d like to show you too. This one sits in the New York City headquarters of Sesame Street and uses Microsoft PixelSense to show visitors that Sesame Workshop is more than a non-profit organization — it is a global endeavor to better the lives of children around the world. Visitors get to stroll (or digitally tap and swipe) their way along The Longest Street in the World.It’s a fine example of the use of the Samsung SUR40 to engage guests in a digital storytelling experience – beautifully delivered with content everyone loves.Tweet
