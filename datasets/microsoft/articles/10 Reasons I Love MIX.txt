Tomorrow sees the start of MIX 11. Alongside Microsoft’s Professionl Developer Conference (PDC), it’s my favorite Microsoft conference – and here are 10 reasons why. The next few days should be a blast. If you can’t make it to Vegas, the two days of keynotes will be streamed live and approximately 130 sessions will be available for download – at live.visitmix.com. And watch for updates here on Next as well. Oh and you can follow MIX with Windows Phone 7 and iPhone apps….and of course via Facebook. <!--
