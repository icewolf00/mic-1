Being in New York this week reminded me to share this awesome short movie from Paul Trillo. Created entirely on the Lumia 1020 by Nokia it’s a trip though 41 blocks of Manhattan.The full interview with Paul over on Nokia Conversations is well worth a read too to hear how it was shot and why the Lumia was used.
