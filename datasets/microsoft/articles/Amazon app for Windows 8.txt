Just in time for my holiday shopping the Amazon app has arrived in the Windows Store. It’s a pretty clean, elegant app that enables you to quickly make purchases, search, compare prices, read reviews, and share products. Though there is a search box right at the top of the app, it also integrates with the Windows 8 search charm hence  + Q gives you quick and easy access to search the full Amazon store. As you may expect, you can also share anything from the app using the share charm (+H) so expect to see me share my wishlists via the app over the next few weeks.Available to download now for free.
