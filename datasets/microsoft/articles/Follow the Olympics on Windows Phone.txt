I’m not making it to London for the Olympics this summer (something I’m actually pleased about) but I will be following the Games closely – on TV and on my Windows Phone courtesy of the Official London 2012 Results app.  The app is free in the Windows Phone Marketplace and provides all the latest news, schedules and results for all Olympic sports and Paralympic sports. The app provides results, live updates, calendar schedule, details of sports, medal tables and athlete profiles.Game on.Tweet
