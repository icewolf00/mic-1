 On Friday, Nokia announced availability of the Lumia 2520 Windows RT tablet. Brandon LeBlanc has a pretty good rundown on the Windows blog of how Nokia’s first Windows tablet is spec’d out and this video gives you a close-up of the tablet’s design. If you simply can’t wait then I’d recommend pre-ordering now.
