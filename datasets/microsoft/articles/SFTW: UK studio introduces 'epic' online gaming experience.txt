Some blokes in the UK came up with a really cool way to spend your Friday, and if you’re a gamer then you should especially take note. Tomorrow, Microsoft Developer and Platform Evangelism (DPE) is hosting a massive on-line alpha test of Age of Ascent, a new player vs. player game developed by UK-based gaming studio, Illyriad Games.Age of Ascent is hosted on Windows Azure and runs in most any browser (Safari being the apparent exception), so DPE and Illyriad are opening this test to any and all comers. In fact, the hope is to break the existing Guinness World Record.Illyriad intends that Age of Ascent introduce a class of on-line gaming called “ultra massively multi-player online games.” So do yourself a favor and block off some time on tomorrow’s calendar.
