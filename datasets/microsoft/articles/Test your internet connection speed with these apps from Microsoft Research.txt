Microsoft Research recently released two excellent new apps for testing and tracking the speed of your internet connections. Network Speed Test is available for Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8, and the design of the free apps is simple and easy to understand as the name. Fire up either app and hit “Start” and a speedometer-like gauge lights up, testing your upload speed, download speed and network delay. The apps also serve up handy information like which activities your current connection can handle, and saves a history of your tests so you can compare speeds over time.There’s more information about the apps on the Microsoft Research site, and both the Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8 versions are now available for download.
