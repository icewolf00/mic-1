The daily twittersphere continues to remind usÂ of the changing landscape of mediaÂ and howÂ we consume information. Thereâ€™s an inordinate amount of raw, unorganized information and insight that captures the analogy of drinking from a fire hose. To remedy the situation, the folks at FUSE LabsÂ built a set of social gadgets that haveÂ been around for a while that I thought would be worth highlighting. Theyâ€™re neat little tools thatÂ can help visuallyÂ  comprehend of all this information and quickly transform it into some level of understanding. In all, there are four fully embeddable gadgets, each of which highlights a different way to dynamically look at Twitter data: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Using them is a breeze and thereâ€™s no setup or ongoing subscription feeâ€¦.theyâ€™re free ðŸ™‚Â  With little to no effort you can quickly identify the main elements of whatever discussion or topic you care about and share that understanding with others. Iâ€™ll warn you, though. It can be a bit addictive!Tweet
