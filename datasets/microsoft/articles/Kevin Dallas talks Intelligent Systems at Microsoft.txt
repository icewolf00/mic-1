Last week I stopped by IDC’s SMART TECHnology World in San Francisco and got the chance to sit down and talk with a number of the speakers. First up was a chat with Kevin Dallas, GM for Windows Embedded at Microsoft. It’s an exciting time for his team as the world of intelligent systems is really starting to take off.In this brief discussion with Kevin, I ask him what has changed it the last 6 months that has seen us develop from talking about the Internet of Things, to the concept of intelligent systems to the reality of customers deploying solutions. We also talk about the Windows Embedded Standard 8 community technology preview.This is the first in a series of interviews – check back soon to hear more from Ford, Intel and IDC.Tweet
