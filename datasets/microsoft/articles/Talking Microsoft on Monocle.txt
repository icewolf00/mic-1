A month or so ago I had the pleasure of sitting down to chat with David Phelan of Monocle during his visit to Microsoft’s Redmond campus for our underground tour.We got to talk about big data, magic windows, and the scale of Microsoft’s technology research.The whole podcast is great stuff – my piece comes in about halfway through at 24 minutes if you’re interested.
