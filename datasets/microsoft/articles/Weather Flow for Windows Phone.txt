My pal Ben Rudolph tipped me off to this beautiful new weather app for Windows Phone over the weekend. Weather Flow has a very clean, elegant Metro style layout (show in the middle images above) or stunning animated photographic images to choose from. You get most things you’d expect from a weather app (though no radar) and Weather Flow does have a one very cool trick up its sleeve:Pin your current location on your screen and the two sided live tile will show not only the current conditions, but also how the weather will be compared to yesterday – and whether it’s a good idea to pack an umbrella. Handy in Seattle some say.Tweet
