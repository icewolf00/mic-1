A few months after Kinect launched, Nordstrom placed a unit in their flagship store in Seattle as part of a fun way to engage customers. Given it’s only half a mile from my apartment, I trotted up there on the night of release and shot a short video and explained why the placement of the installation was particularly well thought out. Check out the original post.More recently, my friends at PSFK introduced their 2011 Future of Retail report recently and it includes several references to Kinect based projects – you can see a summary below and there have been a number of installations since that Nordstrom one.Top Shop collaborated with Razorfish to create a virtual changing room and I tested out something very similar at our recent Worldwide Partner Conference (see below) from FacecakeTweet
