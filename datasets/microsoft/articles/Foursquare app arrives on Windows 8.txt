           It’s great to see that Foursquare is now available on Windows 8. The social app for finding and sharing cool spots around you is one of my favorites, and it makes perfect sense to extend the experience from the phone into a full-featured version for tablets and desktop devices.You can download the app now in the Windows Store (if the link doesn’t work, give it a minute – the app is still propagating across our servers). If you want to swap favorite pubs, you can find me at foursquare.com/stevecla
