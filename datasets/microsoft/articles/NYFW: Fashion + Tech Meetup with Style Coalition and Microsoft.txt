 This is my final post from our New York Fashion Week activities – promise.During the week we partnered with Style Coalition on a lounge at The Empire Hotel that was kitted out with some of the technology being discussed during the week – notably FaceCake’s Swivel virtual fitting room, a Samsung SUR40 with PixelSense running Industrial Color’s GLOBALedit application, the latest Microsoft Hardware and a selection of PCs with Windows 8 and Windows Phones.All of this served as the perfect backdrop for a discussion hosted by Yuli Ziv, founder of Style Coalition, and I regarding the intersection of fashion and technology. The video above gives a brief insight in to that and it was clear from the conversation that this is something that is on the mind of editors and fashionistas and a topic we’re going to see more of in the media – and here on NEXT.
