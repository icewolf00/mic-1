My friends back in the Microsoft Technology Center have been busy with Surface 2.0In this video, David Brown from the MTC demonstrates an application called NUIVerse that is an appropriate play on the word universe. It brings a very natural user interface to exploring the universe. Fast and fluid? Oh yes…It really is a great example of a natural user interface that takes full benefit of the multi touch capability and object recognition of Surface. It’s a long-ish video but stick with it as some of the views of Earth beyond the 6 minute mark are stunning. At around 9 minutes, David start dropping other objects in to space – satellites, space station and even Battlestar Galactica ships.Tweet
