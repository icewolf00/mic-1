Iâ€™ve been waiting on this app for a while and itâ€™s finally here and getting great reviews. I only joined the GoPro crowd last year when some friends bought me the GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition for my snowboarding escapades. Itâ€™s a marvelous bit of kit but as soon as I got it I knew it was crying out for an app that would allow me to control it from my Windows Phone.And now itâ€™s here with full control of all camera settings and most importantly live, remote viewfinder/preview the phone. Read more on the GoPro site. Nokia Lumia 920 users like me get a little more magic. Exclusive for Nokia Lumia Windows Phone 8 smartphones starting with the Lumia 920, the PIP (picture-in-picture) feature allows users to overlay their smartphone camera view on top of the live GoPro view and take photos that are saved to the smartphoneâ€™s camera roll. Grab the app for free from the Windows Phone Store today.Now all I need is some snow ðŸ™‚
