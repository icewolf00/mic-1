Earlier today we added a new blog to the stable of official blogs from the corporate communications team here at Microsoft.The Fire Hose covers the latest developments across the company by curating and linking to the best stuff of the day. This means short, iterative posts combined with a mix of solid, in-depth storytelling. The Fire Hose joins The Official Microsoft Blog, Microsoft on the Issues and of course this blog in the News Center’s family of blogs. Here is a summation of the mission of each of our existing blogs:  Each of our blogs is designed to serve different facets of our company, and we believe the addition of The Fire Hose will help us in our overarching mission to tell Microsoft’s story to the world. Have a look at our new blog. We hope you find it compelling, and we’d love to hear what you think. Feel free to e-mail the Microsoft News Center staff with feedback and suggestions on how to make it better.
