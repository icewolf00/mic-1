 When I get home from work, I often just slump down on my huge Fatboy original to recharge. Very soon my phone will be able to do the same thing.There is much to like about the Nokia Lumia 920 and 820 but perhaps my favorite feature is wireless charging. With a Wireless Charging Pillow from Fatboy, you simply pop either phone down on the pillow and it starts recharging. There are a few other wireless charging options for the 920 and 820 but the Fatboy is my favorite. Oh and it comes in yellow too.Share
