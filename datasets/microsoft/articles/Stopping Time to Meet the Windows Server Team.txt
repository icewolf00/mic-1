Steve Clayton - Editor - Microsoft News Center Staff

There’s a terrific feature about three members of the Windows Server team on the Microsoft News Center today: Betsy Speare, principal program manager lead in the Windows Server Manageability team; Erin Chapple, partner group program manager in the Server and Cloud Division; and Jeffrey Snover, distinguished engineer and lead architect for Windows Server. Click on over to find out why they’d all like to be able to stop time (I suspect you already have the same idea), which one’s a college dropout, and why Windows Server 8 is really going to be a cloud operating system that helps people have great experiences on an increasing variety of connected devices.This may remind you of that great News Center post about the Windows Phone team that ran in December. It’s the next installment in a series about the people behind the technology at Microsoft — one of my favorite angles since we have some of the most brilliant and creative minds in the industry working here.Tweet
