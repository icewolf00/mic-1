This is a guest post by Ryan Asdourian of our OEM marketing team The show floor at CES is a whirlwind. More people than you can imagine and a playground for anyone who loves electronics. In addition to putting together a hardware gallery of some of the latest and greatest Windows PCs, I had a chance to walk around, explore and see all the ways people were luring folks into their booth. Some of the highlights included seeing a full on boxing ring, discounts on products being thrown out to people walking by booths and even a few company mascots running around. The energy is electric and even though you can walk around for hours and even days, there is a pretty good chance you won’t see it all!Our booth alone is pretty massive and is really easy to spend over an hour in. There were some great new product announcements that really pushed innovation boundaries that were in short supply at CES, but if you were lucky you were able to get some hands on experience with them.  On stage during the Microsoft keynote and in our booth, we showcased some brand new PCs and Phones. Both the HP Envy 14 Spectre and the Nokia Lumia 900 took home “Best of CES” awards from CNET. Below includes details on the keynote featured machines. Let’s dive into some of the machines that were on stage.HP Envy 14 Spectre Innovative glass design creates a durable, protective covering for one of HP’s most advanced notebooks. Samsung 9 Series, 2nd Generation Complement your sense of style with an exclusive, premium look. Dell XPS 13 Designed to keep you connected and productive on the road, this ultra-mobile PC packs power and performance into a strikingly small yet durable package. PC SpecsHP Envy 14 SpectreSamsung 9 Series, 2nd GenerationDell XPS 13ProcessorIntel Core i5Intel Core i5 2467MIntel Core i5RAM6 GB4 GB2 GBHard Drive128 GB SSD128 GB SSD128 GB SSDGraphicsATI Radeon HDIntel HD Graphics 3000Intel HD Graphics 3000Screen14.0” HD+ Radiance Display / 1600 x 90013.3”  1600 x  90013.3”1368 x 768HDMI outYesYesNo (DisplayPort)Battery9 hours6 hours7 hoursWeight3.79 pounds2.6 pounds3.06 poundsHeight0.79 inches0.5 inches0.71 inchesERP$1399$1399$999 Thin, light and powerful, all of those PCs and phones are gorgeous and come at an attractive price point.
