I was in the process of writing up a post on all of the keyboard shortcuts I have found in playing with the Windows 8 Consumer Preview yet I had this nagging feeling that the list must exist somewhere. A quick hop over to the Windows Experience Blog confirmed that.In a post by Kent Walter that covered much more ground than just the keyboard shortcuts, he provided a link to download a PDF or XPS document that details everything. It’s well worth a look if you’re running the Consumer Preview. My personal favorite is  + X for power user commands.Be sure to check out Kent’s post for a ton of other useful stuff and enjoy the keyboard goodness and click the video below to see mouse and keyboard in action.Tweet
