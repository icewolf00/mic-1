Halo 4 is just around the corner and I have to confess to being almost as excited about the soundtrack as the game. With Neil Davidge at the helm of the audio accompaniment to the game, it promises to be epic and will be available on October 22nd.And now you have the chance to create your own bit of epic by remixing  one of three tracks Davidge has laid down. In conjunction with SoundCloud, you can download Awakening, To Galaxy and Nemesis and get to work on your mix. Once complete, you upload to SoundCloud and sit back until Oct 29th when the prize winning remixes are announced and some sweet Halo 4 gear gets doled out.Head on over to Halo4Remix.com to learn more and grab the tracks. You can also check out some of the official remixes from Davidge himself.
