&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#160;Not only do my friends in Microsoft Hardware make some beautiful hardware – they make some pretty good videos too. The video of Young Kim talking about the Arc Touch Mouse remains one of my all time favorite videos but they have two new ones on deck that highlight the relationship between devices such as the Wedge Touch Mouse and Windows 8.Personally, I use Surface with a Wedge Touch and they truly are made for each other. Both feel as if they’re hewn from something solid (they are) and look well engineered (they are).  Enhanced Windows 8 Experience and Made for Each Other are the two latest videos.
