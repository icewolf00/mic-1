A few weeks ago I had the chance to sit down for a chat with Dr. Abel Sanchez, Executive Director at MIT’s Geospatial Data Center, to talk about the Internet of Things and its impact on the emergence of intelligent systems. We met at the recent Windows Embedded Executive Summit here in Seattle and found that we share a passion for these topics.The video above is a brief version of our conversation that covers some of the topics I’ve already touched on in this blog. The blurring of the physical and digital worlds, the explosion of data and the challenges that come with that amount of data, such as transfer and storage, and the world of digital natives. I’m going to continue to explore these areas here over the coming months as I think it’s one of the most exciting areas of technology right now – inside and outside of Microsoft.One other thing we share is our admiration for the author William Gibson and his quote:  “The future is already here — it’s just not evenly distributed”Tweet
