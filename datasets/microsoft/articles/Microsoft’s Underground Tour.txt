If you send me an email today, this is the Out of Office message (aka OOF) you will receive*. As you can see, Iâ€™m on something of an anthropologic adventure this week â€“ something we internally call our Underground Tour. Sadly we donâ€™t sell tickets for this but Iâ€™m beginning to wonder if we should do some sort of Willy Wonka golden ticket thing. Hmmmâ€¦For two daysÂ I get to take a small group of invited guests behind the scenes at Microsoft and introduce them to some of the people and places where weâ€™re buildingâ€¦well, cool stuff. Microsoft Research, The Garage, The Envisioning Lab, the hardware Model Shop, Applied Sciences Lab and more. All in all, a fun way to spend two daysâ€¦but this is how I get to spend a lot of my days. Exploring Microsoft. And they pay me to do it ðŸ™‚Anyhow..I just wanted to explain why things are slower than usual around here this week. Hereâ€™s some snaps of the tour in the meantimeâ€¦ Â * â€“ the OOF is something of an art form here in Microsoft. A few years ago I got received an hilarious OOF from a colleague and it brightened up my day. From then on, Iâ€™ve attempted to inject some much needed humor in to my own OOFâ€™s and have a vast collection that are variations on this theme. Just my small contribution to the ebb and flow of a day and the email mountain.Tweet
