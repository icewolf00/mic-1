Surface 2.0 is really starting to gather some momentum and applications like this one can only push that forward. I was only remarking to a friend last week how it’d be great to see a fashion magazine using the capability of Surface to enjoy a digital light table designed for their creative production.  The GLOBALedit App from Industrial Color was shown at the NRF Convention in January and is precisely that. It uses the 360-degree user interface and multi-touch capabilities to bring photo editing, image markups, layout creation, and creative review sessions to life.….paging Anna Wintour.Tweet
