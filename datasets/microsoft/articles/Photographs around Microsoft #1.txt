This is a new series of posts I’m kicking off today. I often take photographs of unusual or inspiring things I see around Microsoft’s Redmond campus so will be posting one each week to the blog. However, this first photo isn’t from Microsoft HQ, it’s from our Worldwide Partner Conference in Toronto – I was there last week and had the opportunity to entertain over 16,000 people across 3 days of keynotes. This amazing photograph by John Edwards was shot as I announced Thievery Corporation who opened day 3 of WPC.Tweet
