 At IFA in Berlin this weekend, hardware vendors are rolling out a ton of new Windows 8 PCs – tablets, notebooks, hybrids and all-in-one desktop PCs. The Windows Team blog features a post this morning from Nick Parker, who provides a quick rundown of what looks to be an amazing line up of new PCs and accessories. I’m currently drooling over the Sony VAIO Duo 11 hybrid. It comes with a pressure-sensitive stylus that mimics the feel of handwriting on the touch screen. Sweet!Way too much eye candy for a single blog. Tweet
