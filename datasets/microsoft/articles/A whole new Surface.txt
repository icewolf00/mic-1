This morning I got to hang out at the Surface launch event in New York City and see all of the new hardware first hand. As an industrial design fan, I couldn’t put the Surface 2 down – it’s a thing of beauty, expertly crafted as shown in the video above.The other thing that caught my attention was the Wireless Adapter for Typing Covers. It’s a beautifully elegant solution that forges a Bluetooth connection between any Surface Typing Cover and Surface.  Check out all the details on the Surface blog and News Center and come back soon for an exclusive interview with Panos Panay, vice president of Surface.
