Until now, Moulinex always conjured up images of household appliances – food processors, irons and the like. Add in another “L” and you have Moullinex. From today, I will have a new image in my mind…the video above, conjured up by some interesting adaptation of what a Kinect sensor sees. Moullinex are a band and the track above is Catalina from their Chocolat EP. Luis Clara Gomes and Luis Calçada explain what you’re seeing and Fast Company’s CoDesign adds the props. <!--
