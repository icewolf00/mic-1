Xbox SmartGlass provided great coverage of the US election last night – I was watching on my Xbox 360 with companion content on my Surface using SmartGlass. In future, I hope all events are delivered that way. Soccer games with real-time player stats based on who is on the ball, F1 race details based on who is on screen, tennis stats during the game and more. These aren’t promises of future experiences but they all seem pretty obvious – and realistic to me.And as of last night, iOS devices can joint the party. Grab Xbox SmartGlass from the Apple App Store.
